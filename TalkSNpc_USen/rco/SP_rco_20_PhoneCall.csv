"002_01","d\0Stupendous! I'm relieved to hear
that everything is going according
to plan.\0\0Be sure to check the \0box\0￿ in front of
the plot for each home. It'll show the
items required for that plot.
Interior items should be placed in the
\0box\0￿, while exterior items should be
placed outside around the plot.
We want to make it look nice and
decorative, now, hm?d"
"002_02","d\0n\0\0Ah, yes!
\0 You're going to need a
wreath made from \0flowers\0￿ as well.\0\0There are plenty of beautiful flowers
blooming \0up on the cliffs\0￿ of

get every permit available!d"
