\0((촀\0Looks like you don't
have anybody on your friend list

it when they come visit.
( 촀\0Oh, but you should know that the
code is only good for THIS visit.
\0(
(촀\0Next time'll have a different code."

\0 there's no easy way to
talk about this, 

your Passport while you're playing
together,

\0come on
back and we'll set you up."
