tonight's presentation as well?"

begin!

to remembern"
"006","()촀\0I've prepared some lovely gifts as
part of the fireworks show tonight,

"007","(촀\0I must admit, 
\0I'm intrigued by what's
happening at that stall over theren\0\0\0\0(7촀\0I suppose drawing a raffle ticket
wouldn't be such a bad idea."
"008","(4촀\0You haven't mentioned it, 
\0so I guess
I'll just askn\0\0
\0 (7촀\0What do you think of
my \02\0Ā촃star bopper\0￿? 
\0Does it suit me?
(4촀\0I like to dress up a bit on special
occasions such as these, 
\0but I have
been known to get carried away.
(촀\0But I've also been known to get
carried away with the idea that I'm
getting carried away!"

special to know we're sharing this

recommend it enough."

"014","($촀\0I'm honored that you're here for
n\0's fireworks show!\0\0(촀\0We may not be the fireworks capital
of the world, 
\0(촀\0but I think you'll be
impressed by our presentation."
"015","(촀\0I have a little something for everyone
as a part of today's event."
"016","(촀\0I got everyone a little something as
part of today's event, but I don't

(6촀\0Another added benefit is that it'll
make you easy to spot! 

pretty dark out here at night."

fireworks with someone by your side

begun, and I'm already blown out of
the water.

evening to the fullest!"

"028","($촀\0Did any custom-design fireworks
catch your eye?\0\0()촀\0Sometimes we choreograph the
fireworks so the custom designs
appear in a set order together.

don't want to miss them."
"030","(촀\0If you ask me,

here on n\0.(촀"

(촀\0I can't help but feel beyond grateful
that I decided to take this job."

\0the bad news is that was the last
fireworks show of the year.\0\0(\0촀\0The good news? 
\0(촀\0Now we can look
forward to next year's offerings!"
"035","(촀\0I think it's appropriate that the last
fireworks show also marks the start
of a new season.
(1촀\0The best part about endings is that
they open up all kinds of possibilities
for new beginnings."
"036","(촀\0Well, at least that last fireworks show
was a true success.\0\0(%촀\0Tomorrow everything'll be back to
normal, and I'll be behind the desk,
working Resident Services again.
But now I'm feeling (""촀\0extra inspired
to give it my all!"
"037","I guess after tonight, I'll have to
retire my \02\0Ā촃star bopper \0￿for the year.

It's a shamen\0\0

eerily quiet after a fireworks show?

(촀\0I miss all the excitement."
"039","(촀\0I love the fact that even visitors here
