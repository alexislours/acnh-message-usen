"101","So I was strollin' along the beach,
listening to the waves roll in, when
suddenly I had this rad DIY idea."
"102","It turns out great DIY ideas can hit
at really inconvenient times. Like
juuuuust as I'm falling asleep."
"103","I was out gardening, elbow deep in
dirt and face bumping my flowers,
when I got this way-cool DIY idea."
"104","I was reading a letter I got from my
dad back home, and something he
wrote gave me a solid DIY idea."
"105","I was out doing...whatever I like to
do (none of your business and who
cares?) and got this cool DIY idea."
"201","I was gonna keep it to myself, but
it's so good I just had to share."
"202","Then I had a crazy idea for sharing
that recipe, and here we are."
"203","I wrote the recipe down as quick as
I could in case I forgot it."
"204","And then I thought, where's the fun
in keeping the recipe to myself."
"205","I figured SOMEBODY out there
would wanna try building it."
"301","Well, from here it's all you!"
"302","So get to it! Build build build!"
"303","And with that... Good luck!"
"304","You've got this. I believe in you!"
"305","I promise it might not explode."

"501","I came up with a rockin' recipe for
a DIY mirror a bit ago and thought
you'd wanna check it out. It's easy
to make, plus you can check out
your hair or whatever with it. Give
it a whirl and see what you think!"
