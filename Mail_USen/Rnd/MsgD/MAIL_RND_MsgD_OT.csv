"003","To my faraway reader,"
"004","Dearest whoever you are,"
"005","My dear anonymous reader, "
"101","Whilst taking a much-needed hot
bath, my mind dreamed up the most
fabulous idea for a DIY recipe."
"102","I was on an aimless stroll when an
idea for the most wonderful DIY
recipe came to me on the breeze."
"103","I can NOT stop thinking about this
furniture I saw in a dream! So,
I have turned it into a DIY recipe."
"104","I've grown weary of run-of-the-mill
furniture. So, I have designed a DIY
furniture recipe sure to inspire!"
"105","Would you believe—an amazing DIY
recipe simply popped into my mind
as I was enjoying a cup of tea!"
"201","Of course, I believe great ideas
such as mine MUST be shared."
"202","Now I find myself compelled to
share this recipe with others."
"203","It would be cruel of me to keep this
recipe to myself, so I am sharing."
"204","I am compelled to share my recipe,
so I have stuffed it in this bottle."
"205","I cannot keep this idea to myself.
So I have placed it in this bottle."
"301","May it inspire you to action."
"302","Please. Bring this recipe to life."
"303","Try making it. You will not be sorry."
"304","Do please consider making it!"
"305","It would please me if you made it."
"401","Best wishes, n
"
"402","With hopes, n
"
"403","Your muse, n
"
"404","Sincerely, n
"
"405","Faraway wishes, n

"501","Are you paying proper attention to
your appearance, darling? A mirror
can help you put yourself together.
I've included a DIY mirror recipe
in this bottle. Do make one for
yourself when the mood strikes."
