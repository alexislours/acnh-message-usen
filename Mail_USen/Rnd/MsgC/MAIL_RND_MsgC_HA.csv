"101","Thanks for the card! Those were
some really good words you sent."
"102","Your card was such a surprise that
I don't know what to write back."
"103","Thanks for the card! I wish I could
write mighty words like that."
"104","I read your card so many times that
my eyeceps started getting sore!"
"105","I read the card you sent me all the
way to the end. What a workout!"
"201","I think writing letters hits different
muscles than pumping iron. This is
really, really hard."
"202","I'm a lifter, not a letter-writer guy,
so I'm getting a ton of mind-muscle
soreness just writing this."
"203","I got this awesome, ultra-heavy pen
so I can tone my fingers while
I write. First time using it!"
"204","Well, I spent a whole day writing
that, so I'm gonna double up my
reps tomorrow. Can't wait!"
"205","My brain muscle's all cramped up,
so I don't know what else to say.
Writer's blocks are heavy!"
"301","Well, we should hang out soon!"
"302","Time for a good, long jog."
"303","Enough mind reps for one day."
"304","Did you read to the end?"
"305","This letter came out awesome!"
