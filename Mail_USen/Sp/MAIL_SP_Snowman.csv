"006","Thanks!"
"101","I want you to have this as a thanks
for making me...me! Now you're a
step closer to being as cool and
cracklin' as I am! How chill is that?
Thanks again!"
"102","Thanks for making me look so cool!
I'll give you this item to say thanks,
and I'm hoping it'll make you as
chill and ice-cool as me!"
"103","I'm really happy I met you this
winter! I'll give you this frosty-cool
item as a thank-you for exercising
your pro-level, snow-rolling skills.
I hope you're the one who makes
me next time too!"
"104","You really gotta let me thank you!
Sure, I'll melt away someday, but
this is a special item for a special
time, and it won't blink in the heat
of summer. You can hold onto it for
a very long time!"
"105","I've got nothing but gratitude for
you, friend. You made me so well,
I'm dripping with coolness. I'm so
cool, I feel like my chill memory
will stick around even after I've
melted away."
"106","As a special treat for making me,
I'm gonna teach you how to make
one cool item! But if you've never
done a DIY project before, you
should take the DIY workshop held
in Resident Services."
