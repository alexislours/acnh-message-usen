"001","My dear n\0,"
"101_01","As I greet the New Year,
I've decided to become one of
those fancy ""hobby"" people.

If my creativity were a flower,
it would be in full bloom."
"102_01","I blow onto my icy hands to
warm them... It doesn't work,
but it's something to do.

If I stitch fast enough, maybe I'll
be able to feel my fingers again."
"103_01","Like a cheap candle, the snow is
melting fast, replaced by lovely
flowers and plants.

Spring sure knows how to make
an entrance."
"104_01","Cherry-blossom petals dance upon
the wind, like some kind of bizarre
battalion of breeze ballerinas.

A smile graces my face as I watch
the petals fall. All is well until..."
"105_01","The smell of trees and freshly cut
grass brings out the adventurer in
me. Wandering season is upon us!

I'm not sure which I like better,
wandering or meandering..."
"106_01","Fireflies light up the night sky,
taking my mind off the stresses
of the day.

As I watch, amazed and distracted,
the mosquitoes make their move."
"107_01","The cicadas cry into the morning
light, awakening the world with
their cacophonous symphony.

Your mother cries out as well,
lamenting her lack of sleep."
"108_01","When I see a falling star, I close
my eyes and wish for... Nice try,
darling! It's a secret, of course.

Here's to making wishes and
chasing dreams."
"109_01","Ah, that brief time of year when
nature is too indecisive to be
either too hot or too cold.

If only my own indecisiveness was
this enjoyable!"
"110_01","With apple-stuffed cheeks, I take
long walks and read long books.
I take long naps in long pajamas.

This time of year is wonderful,
but far too short."
"111_01","Something about seeing piles of
colorful leaves everywhere puts
me in the mood to bake.

Pies! Cakes! Muffins! Biscuits!
I can't fight this. I won't."
"112_01","The house is covered in snow,
like a thick blanket. One that's
cold and wet...

As I battle the bitter cold, I think
of you and sew through the night."

"151_01","Whenever I see a plane, I think of
you and wave at those airborne
strangers with all my might.

I had no idea how many flights took
off each day. My arm is exhausted."
"151_02","How is your new life treating you?
Are you eating well? Brushing your
teeth? Washing behind your ears?

Oh dear, I'm all worked up... Here's
a little something to help out."
"152_01","Today you're one year older and
one year wiser. Maybe it's time to
give broccoli another go?

No matter what, you'll always be
my baby."
"152_02","Do you remember when we first
met? Of course not, silly. But it
was on this very day.

If that's not cause to celebrate,
I don't know what is."
