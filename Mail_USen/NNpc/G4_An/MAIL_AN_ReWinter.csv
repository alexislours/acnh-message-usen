"101","Thanks for taking the time to find a
present for me. And with a nice
card too! I dunno how you do it,
but you always seem to find a way
to look after your pals. Makes me
glad to be one of them!"
"102","You managed to send out cards in
the holiday season?! I wish I could
be as together as you! All that and
a present on top...you're gonna
make everyone look bad! Not me
though. I got your gift right here."
"103","Ah, the classic card-present
combo. Nice. I know it's supposed
to be the least you can do for
a friend at the holidays, but not
everyone can pull it off. Lucky for
you I always go the extra mile!"
"104","Your card made me more sure than
ever that this next year is gonna
rock! I've got a to-do list as long
as my arm and you know what? I
think I'm gonna get to all of it this
time. You and me, buddy! Let's go!"
"105","You sure are on top of things, with
your holiday cards in people's
mailboxes and not in a stack on
your kitchen table. It inspired me
to start getting things done, and
the proof is in your hands now!"
"106","Thanks for the holiday card! The
next year's just around the corner,
so it's a good time to start getting
fired up about it! But not TOO fired
up. I'm trying to take it easy a little
this year, to see how it feels."
