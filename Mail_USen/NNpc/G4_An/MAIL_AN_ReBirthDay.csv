"101","Thanks for the b-day gift! Sending
me a card was already a cool thing
to do, and the present was like the
cherry on top of the ""you"" sundae.
I figured the least I could do was
get you something too!"
"102","What's the big idea, trying to make
me cry?! My heart got all tight and
squeezy when I opened your card
and present. It doesn't really stack
up with what you gave me, but I
wanna give you this anyway."
"103","Yo, it was super cool of you to
send a present along with the card.
After all, the only thing better than
mail day is package day! Which you
probably know, since you just got
a package from me. Woo!"
"104","I got your b-day card! That was
super thoughtful of you. Doesn't
matter how old I get, as long as I
got friends to keep the party
going, then I'm having a blast.
So yeah! Let's keep it going!"
"105","I did a double take this morning
when I saw your b-day card in my
mailbox! You sly spy, pulling such
a classy move like it's no big deal.
Well, it was a big deal to me! I'm
STILL smiling! So, thanks again."
"106","Your b-day card sure put a smile
on my face. Thanks, buddy. You're
always setting a good example
when it comes to being a stand-up
friend. I feel like my next year of
being alive is off to a rockin' start!"
