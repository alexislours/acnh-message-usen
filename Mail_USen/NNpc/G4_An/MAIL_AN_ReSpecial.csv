"009","You rock, n\0!"
"010","Well, n\0..."
"011","To the incredible n\0,"
"012","Whoa, n\0!"
"013","Yo, n\0!"
"018","Love the gift, n\0!"
"019","Wow! 2\0n\0!"
"020","Sup, n\0?"
"021","Hey, n\0!"
"101","I look totally awesome in the
clothes you sent. Thanks a ton for
those! I was talking to a buddy and
they said I should send you a taste
of my own fashion in return. I bet
you're gonna look like a rock star!"
"102","How far out of your way did you
go to find clothes for me? I look
totally rad! I don't even want to
think about how much effort you
put into this. All I know is I gotta
try to repay the favor. You rock!"
"103","Are you in my head? How did you
know I was gonna buy EXACTLY the
clothes you sent? Because I don't
remember telling you! Well, two can
play at that game. Here's
something I saw you eyeballing!"
"104","You ever wanted something for so
long that you didn't know what to
do once you got it? You totally
nailed it on that furniture you got
me. I got you a little thank-you gift.
You are AWESOME!"
"105","I just got your present, and I'm
kinda confused. I've been saving
up to buy this exact thing, but
now I don't know what to do with
the extra Bells. Ha! Big problem,
right? Anyhoo, here's a thanks!"
"106","I got your gift and whoa! You really
know how to accent a room! It's
kinda cool (and weird) when you
get exactly what you didn't know
you were missing. I'm gonna bug
you when I redecorate! Thanks!"
"107","Thanks for the furniture, but...did
you know I already had one? Or
is it the kind of thing I need to
stock up on? How many should I
get? Oh, I got you something I
hope you don't already have. Ha!"
"108","I knew EXACTLY what you sent
before I even opened it. Love that
smell! I wanted to get a thank-you
gift, but was at a loss for what. I
took a wild guess that I hope you
like. If not, hey, I tried!"
"109","I was SUPER stoked to get the
garden stuff! Seriously made my
week! I haven't picked a spot for
them yet, but once I do, I'll take
awesome care of them. Come
visit the flowers anytime!"
"110","I don't have a clue where I'm gonna
plant your sapling, but I'll figure it
out. Mostly I just wanna say thanks,
and that I'll make it grow tall. I also
wanted to send a little gift of my
own. Hope it grows on you!"
"111","Well, Bells! That was the last thing
I expected! Not that I don't need
them. They'll be put to good use.
Mostly this letter is just to say
thanks. I needed a pick-me-up.
Oh, and I got you a little thing."
"112","You are a rock star with a rock star
face! Any chance you played on
this album? Reminds me of when I
bounced around a few bands. I was
awful, but it was fun. Well, here's
to the old days!"
"113","No such thing as too many tools!
I'm always wearing mine out or
losing them. I can't even guess
how many I've buried in the yard.
Well, now it's my turn to send
something along. Hope it's useful!"
"118","Fossils are rad. They make me think
about history and stuff. Like what
was the world like back then? I
wonder that a lot. Here's a little
thank-you. It won't rock as hard as
a fossil (ha!), but what does?"
"119","WOW! I don't even think Blathers
has seen this fossil yet! It's like
a museum sneak preview! So
awesome! I don't have anything
half as cool to send, so I hope you
REALLY like this letter."
"120","I love the wall art you sent. In fact,
I love it so much, I already had
one! Got a laugh out of that. The
old one was pretty dusty though,
so I put the new one up. Here's
something I hope's new to you! Ha!"
"121","Your gift was a total surprise!
I thought I missed a holiday or
forgot my birthday or something.
Way to confuse a gal! I got you a
little something to return the favor.
I hope it gives you a giggle!"
