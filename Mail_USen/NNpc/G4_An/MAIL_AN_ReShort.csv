"101","I got your letter and gift! I liked
that you let the present speak for
itself. I totally knew what you were
going for, and I liked knowing you
knew I'd know that. I bet you'll
figure out what this is about too."
"102","Thanks for the present! The short
note you sent with it made it seem
like a mystery, and opening up the
gift felt like solving it. I thought
you might like that feeling too, so
I sent you this in return. Or did I?!"
"103","There weren't a lot of words in that
letter, but I could tell you picked
every one of them carefully. That's
some talent you got! Thanks for
thinking of me, and here's a thing
to show I'm thinking of you too."
"104","Got your message. Short, sweet
and to the point. Not bad. Gave me
some ideas. Think I'll try it for
myself. It's already getting long
though. I need a sign-off too?
This is harder than it looks."
"105","Thanks for the letter! You know
how to keep it short and sweet,
huh? That might have backfired
though... It was SO short that I
read it over and over, trying to find
hidden meanings!"
"106","Thanks for the letter. It didn't take
long to read, which was cool. Can't
stand when people won't get to the
point about stuff! Hmm, I should
follow my own advice, huh? Yeah,
this letter's over now!"
