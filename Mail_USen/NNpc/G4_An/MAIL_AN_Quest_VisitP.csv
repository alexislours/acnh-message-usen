"101","Your place is the COOLEST. It felt
like a party just standing in it. And
that was without letting me put up
decorations and stuff. I can't wait
to come back and party with you
some more! If that's OK, I mean."
"102","It was great hanging out at your
place together, so I thought I'd
send a little thank-you note. Hey,
but for real, what's with that one
door behind the furniture? Is there
a secret behind it? I gotta know!"
"103","Thanks for having me over! Your
place feels very...homey. Or maybe
""lived-in"" is better? I'm not trying
to tell you how to live your life, but
I thought you might want one of
these to add to the clutter."
"104","Consider this my thanks for having
me over to hang out. But I have to
ask...was your furniture in time-out
or something? Haha, I'm kidding.
Kinda. Seriously, I've never seen
anyone else go with that layout..."
"105","I really thought when I came over
to see your place that it'd have
more stuff in it. Don't get me
wrong, I like the frugal style, but
a little furniture wouldn't cramp it
too much. Try this out, maybe?"
"106","I had a great time hanging out!
It was cool how your place kinda
had a little bit of everything. It
helped me figure out a few things
my own pad is missing! I got you
this as thanks for the inspiration."
"107","I had such a good time at your
place the other day! The walls were
barer than I'd go with, but hey, if
that's your thing... Still, if you want
to spruce them up some, here's
something I think would be perfect."
"108","Whew. You had so much rare stuff
at your house I almost went cross-
eyed staring at it all. I dunno if it's
up to your standards, but I got you
something for giving me the tour.
Hope it's not TOO ordinary..."
"109","I had fun at your place! You've got
so much swanky furniture, it felt
like I was visiting royalty or a really
high-class museum. I got you this
gift as kind of a belated entry fee.
Hope it's not too cheap!"
"110","It was nice getting the chance to
see where you live. It's easy to
walk around in, I'll give it that, but
don't you ever wish you had more
furniture? You should at least have
one of these, if you ask me!"
"111","I loved getting the tour of your
place! But there wasn't much room
to maneuver, if you get me. I get
that it can be hard to let go of
stuff, but being able to walk around
without tripping is nice too."
"112","I was so stoked to get to visit you!
Hanging around there was like
being in a second home. It felt so
good that I figured I should give
you this! And hey, next time, let's
hang out at my place. Deal?"
