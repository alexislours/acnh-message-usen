"101","Here's that present you didn't have
room for. I hated to see you go
without it, so I made a note to get
it to you as quick as (legally)
possible. Hope the rest of your
year is as rad as your party was!"
"102","Here's that birthday present from
before. NOW will you take it? Can't
wait to see what you've got in
store for us over the next year!
Keep crushin' it! If, you know,
that's what you feel like doing."
"103","It's a little late, but your b-day gift
is in your hands at last! So, what's
the plan for the next year? You
gotta figure that stuff out sooner
than later! Whatever it is, good
luck and stay revved up!"
"104","I dunno if you noticed, but I got
pretty choked up at your b-day
party. All those people celebrating
you made me wanna shout out
loud! I held it in though. Oh yeah,
here are those leftover cupcakes!"
"105","Your party was THE talk of the
island, buddy! Sometimes it seems
like the only thing all of us here
have in common is that we're pals
with you. Oh yeah, here are the
cupcakes you left behind!"
"106","I thought so, anyway. Hope you had
as much fun as me! Oh! I said I was
gonna send you your leftover
cupcakes, so I packed 'em in with
this letter. Hmm, they're not gonna
get smushed, are they? Hope not!"
"107","Thanks for sharing your cupcakes
with me! Guess it was pretty
obvious that I wanted one, bwa ha!
I was gonna pay you back, but your
hands were full, so I'm doing it now
instead. See you around!"
"108","Yo, that cupcake you gave me was,
like...everything. I was floating for
hours on that sugary sweetness.
I didn't want you to go empty-
handed for being so nice to me, so
here's that gift I tried giving you."
"109","Super generous of you to share
YOUR OWN birthday cupcakes with
us. Especially me! I wanted to give
you this before, but I guess it
wasn't the right time. It's nothing
special, but I hope you like it."

\0!"
