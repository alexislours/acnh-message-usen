"101","Happy birthday again! I'll repeat it
all I want! Happy birthday! This is
the present I had! Happy birthday!
But you had full pockets!
Happy birthday!"
"102","I'm sending the present I couldn't
get to you before because of your
pocket problems.
I bet your face looks
excited when you open it!
Hurry and open it!"
"103","I'm sending you the present you
couldn't fit in your pockets. I'm
home from the party now, and the
bugs say ""hi!"" I just told them you
said ""hi"" back since they mostly
don't know how postcards work."
"104","Your birthday party was so much
fun! Here are the cupcakes you
couldn't fit in your pockets.
They're yours now, so eat 'em,
or pass 'em out, or even do what
I do—eat 'em until ya pass out!"
"105","I'm sending you the cupcakes
you couldn't fit in your pockets!
Here's a tip—they woulda fit if
you'd squished 'em in there! Then
when ya got home, you could eat 
them out of your pockets!"
"106","Here are the cupcakes you got
from the piñata! They smell so
good, I was afraid I'd eat one!
I ALMOST licked one twice, but
I just licked once. I smushed the
icing around, so ya can't really tell."
"107","Happy birthday, the other day!
Thanks for the cupcake the other
day! Here's the present I couldn't
hand to you the other day! I hope
you like it today!"
"108","Haaappy!!! Birthdaaay!!!
2\0n\0!!!
Here's the birthday present
you didn't have room for! I hope
you think it smells good and/or
is nice to touch."
"109","Thanks for sharing your cupcakes 
with me! I coulda ate 1,000, but it's
good I only had one, 'cause I got
no room for 1,000! I'd EXPLODE! 
Everywhere! A huh huh huh...gross.
Oh! Here's a present!"
