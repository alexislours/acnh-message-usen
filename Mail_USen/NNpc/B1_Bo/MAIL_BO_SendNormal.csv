"003","So, n\0!"
"004","Hi!"
"005","Tell me, n\0!"
"006","Hey, n\0?"

"009","Hiiii, n\0!"
"010","Guess what, n\0?"
"101","I had a dream that me and you
climbed a mountain! In the dark!
At the top was a couch. We sat and
ate snacks and watched the sun
come up. It was real chill and fun."
"102","I've been itching to write you a
card ever since I woke up this
morning! Actually...I've been 
itching ever since I woke up
this morning!"
"103","Were you wearing your clothes
backwards the other day, or
were you walking backwards?

Either way, it was real neat, man."
"104","

I like sending postcards to friends.


Should I write more?"
"105","What did you have for dinner
last night? Will ya have it again
tonight? Can I have some? I'll
bring my own plate."
"106","Did you know that books are
just a buncha letters? And there's
only, um, I gotta count...
OK! There's only 104 letters.
How do they make such 
big books with that few letters?"
"107","Isn't this postcard pretty?
I don't want to cover it up with too
much of my writing, because I think
it is pretty and I should let you see
it. That is why I am only writing a
few words and then I am done."
"108","I like writing letters because it
makes me think about how my
grandma wrote letters before
people quit writing letters.
Write a letter, n\0!
Be like my grandma!"
"109","Do you like how this
postcard smells?
I dipped it in gravy,
then licked the gravy off
and sent it to you!"
"110","It's time for a riddle!

What did the cake say
while cutting an onion?
