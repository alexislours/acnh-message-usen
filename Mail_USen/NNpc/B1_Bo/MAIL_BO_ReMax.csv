"101","I was so surprised by
all the cards you sent!
It was the most I ever got!

Here's a prize!"
"102","My mailbox was stuffed fulla cards
and presents! Was it my birthday
and I forgot? Or was it my
MAILBOX'S birthday? When is
YOUR mailbox's birthday? Here's
a present, in case it's today!"
"103","I fell asleep trying to read
through all your cards!
I drooled in my sleep, and
woke up with a couple cards
stuck to my face! It was neat!
Here's a present because I like ya!"
"104","Thanks for the cards!
It made me so happy seeing
how many you sent me.
I built a card tower out of them!
I'm clumsy so it wasn't real
tall. It's fun to do anyway!"
"105","Thanks for all the cards!
I kept looking at them and talking
to the bugs about them and
I forgot to sleep! I didn't forget
to eat though! I ate a whole bag of
chips. The whole bag!"
"106","I was so worried that all of the
cards you sent were supposed to
be in a certain order. I spent ALL
NIGHT talking with the bugs in the
wall and the bugs in the floor, and
we think we've got it figured it out."
