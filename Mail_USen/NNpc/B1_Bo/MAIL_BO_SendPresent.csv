"001","I got ya a thing, n\0!"
"002","Hey, n\0! Ya old-timer!"
"003","2\0n\0!"
"004","Do ya buy clothes, n\0?"
"005","2\0n\0, I have two feet."
"006","You like tea, right, n\0?"
"007","Dear n\0's brain,"
"008","Hey, n\0!"
"009","Question for you, n\0..."
"010","Super-pal n\0,"
"101","I wanted to surprise you with a
thing, so I bought you a thing and
sent it to you because I wanted
you to have it! Now you have the
thing! I sent it to you! Enjoy it!
It's your thing now! Yay!"
"102","A huh, that's a joke! ""Old-timer""!
Because ""throwback"" furniture.
Ha! Thought of that, I dunno, three
days ago? Anyway, I saw this and
thought of you. And I also wanted
to say the ""old-timer"" joke."
"103","I bought this costume so I could
play pretend! Buuut the bugs in the
floor get freaked out every time I
put it on. You seem like the kinda
person that can play dress up
without scaring a buncha bugs."
"104","I saw this when I was out shopping.
I thought it'd go on your body
because they made it with holes
for your body to fit through. I hope
that your body fits inside of it.
Do you like my surprise present?"
"105","But I have more than two shoes?
And other types of things that go
on my feet and legs! It's probably
too much for me, so I'm sending
some to you. I know you have feet
AND legs. I've seen them!"
"106","Did you know that tea is so popular
that they named a whole letter in
the alphabet after it? Nothing else
is that popular! Except maybe
bees. Oh, and the sea. Anyway,
I got U something 4 T time!"
"107","Do you like artsy stuff? 'Cause I
found something real neat when
I was cleaning. It made my brain
think all kinds of weird thoughts
just by staring at it! Isn't that
cool? Now it's your turn!"
"108","I was looking for a piece of candy I
dropped under my bed and found
this. It's hard as a rock! I'm pretty
sure it's not the candy I dropped.
Unless it turns out to be a toffee
bar...then it is and I want it back."
"109","You know the way the sun goes
away and everything gets real dark
and boring? Well, how about if
everything didn't need to get real
dark and boring? Think about it!"
"110","I got a new snack bag in the mail
so I'm sending you my old one. It's
seen me through a lot of real hard
candies so take good care of it.
Also it's kinda sticky at the bottom
so watch out for that."
