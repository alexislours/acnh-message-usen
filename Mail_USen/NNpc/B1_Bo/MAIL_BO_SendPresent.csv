"101","I wanted to surprise you with a
thing, so I bought you a thing and
sent it to you because I wanted
you to have it! Now you have the
thing! I sent it to you! Enjoy it!
It's your thing now! Yay!"
"102","A huh, that's a joke! ""Blockhead!""
Because ""wooden block"" furniture.
Ha! Thought of that, I dunno, three
days ago? Anyway, I saw this and
thought of you. And I also I wanted
to say the ""blockhead"" joke."
"103","I bought this costume so I could
play pretend! Buuut the bugs in the
floor get freaked out every time I
put it on. You seem like the kinda
person that can play dress up
without scaring a buncha bugs."
"104","I saw this when I was out shopping.
I thought it'd go on your body
because they made it with holes
for your body to fit through. I hope
that your body fits inside of it.
Do you like my surprise present?"
"105","But I have more than two shoes?
I don't need more than two shoes.
And the bugs say my extra shoes
smell too bad to live in. I know
you have two feet. Do you have
two shoes?"
