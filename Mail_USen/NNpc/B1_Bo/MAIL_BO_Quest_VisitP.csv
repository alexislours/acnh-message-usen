"101","I had a buncha fun the
other day! Invite me over
again sometime. I'm real
curious about the
secret rooms I haven't
seen yet!"
"102","I had so much fun hanging out at
your place the other day! I promise
I won't tell nobody about the
secret room I found! I wanna
see what's inside next time!"
"103","Thanks for showing me
your place the other day.
If you ya wanna clean up
the stuff that was on
your floor, you should
use this thing!"
"104","Your house was so neat!
Next time I'm over, can ya
teach me how to use
that furniture that was
facing the wrong way?"
"105","It was cool seeing your house.
I thought maybe you could use this.
Furniture is kinda my thing.
That, and bugs.
And snacks.
A lotta things are my thing."
"106","Your house was so nice!
I have this thing that I think
would look real neat with 
your things. I am giving it
to you so you can put it with
your things."
"107","It's real fun hanging out at friend's
houses! You can pretend like ya
live there. And you can think, ""Man,
there's way less hand prints on
these walls."" OH! Here's a thing for
YOUR walls. It's not a hand print."
"108","Your place has so much rare stuff,
it's like a museum!
I didn't touch anything!
(Blathers always says no touching.)
I hope I can come by again!
(I won't touch anything!)"
"109","You have so much expensive stuff
in your house! I was worried I'd
break things, so I tried to keep
track of my body all the time.
But I got you a present just in case
I forgot where my body was."
"110","Thanks for having
me over the other day!
I had loads of fun.
Your place seemed a bit
empty, so take this!
I hope ya like it!"
"111","A huh huh, you're like me!
You don't like cleaning up either!
But ya gotta, I guess. That's what
my mom and dad always said!
Here! Maybe this will help ya!
I'm done not using it."
"112","Thanks for the other day!
It was so cozy at your place that
I stayed for a real long time!
I'm sending you a thank-you gift.
I hope you like it!
Let's hang out again!"
