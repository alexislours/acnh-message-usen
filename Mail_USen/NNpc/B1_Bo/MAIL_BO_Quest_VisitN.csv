"101","Thanks for coming over the 
other day! You can come over

bring snacks. Or a fish to look
at! Anyway, here's that gift I
couldn't give ya!"
"102","Thanks for coming to visit the
other day! It was real nice to eat
snacks, chill out, and goof off a
bunch! Also, it's nice to have
someone else leave crumbs behind.
Here's that gift I couldn't give ya!"
"103","Thanks for hanging out the
other day! Did ya have fun?
I had tons of fun! You have the
best confused looks! Come over
and get confused again sometime.
I hope you like this gift!"
"104","Y'know how I was like, ""I'll send
it to you!"" when you were over?
Well, I remembered! Remembering
things feels funny. ""Oh yeah"" feels
like a pillow, but ""I forgot"" feels like
a stale chip."
