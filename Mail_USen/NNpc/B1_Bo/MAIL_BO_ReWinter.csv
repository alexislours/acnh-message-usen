And the present was real neat!
I think they call it ""heartwarming""?
But my heart is inside me, and it's
already warm in there, so I dunno!"

that I needed to send you a card,
so I went and bought cards, but I
couldn't find a pen, so I went and
bought a pen, and then I came
home and wrote this!"
