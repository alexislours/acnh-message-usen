"020","Hey there, n\0!"
"021","A huh huh huh! Hi, n\0!"
"101","Oh man, I tried on the
outfit you sent! I look real
handsome! I'm gonna strut
around the island and do
stuff handsome dudes do."
"102","I love the outfit ya sent
me the other day! I loved it
SO much, I bought more!
Now I can wear that
outfit every day without
worrying about stains!"
"103","The outfit you gave me
fits PERFECTLY! Did you
take my measurements when
I wasn't looking?! In case it
was just a lucky guess, I'm
a size RCD (Real Cool Dude)."
"104","I tried to decorate my place
with the furniture you sent,
but I gotta do some cleaning
first! Don't worry, man. I'll
get to it real soon. Probably.
I'll keep it safe till then!"
"105","Thanks for the furniture!
I've been thinking about
where to put it, but...
I can't decide, man!
It could go ANYWHERE!
I gotta figure this out."
"106","I was so surprised when
I opened your package!
New furniture! How the
heck did it fit into
that package?!"
"107","Did you know that I already
have a furniture like you
sent me? Now I've got two!
My house is in stereo, man!"
"108","Thanks for the gift!
It looks so yummy... I might...
OK! I just ate it!
It WAS real yummy! Thanks!
Here's a thank-you gift.
I hope you like it!"
"109","The flower stuff you sent blew all
over when I sneezed! But I picked
'em all up, and I'll keep 'em in my
pocket until they sprout!"
"110","I'm gonna plant the sapling
you sent me in the best spot
on the island! I've walked
around all day, looking for
that perfect spot! But I keep
getting lost! Send help!"
"111","I never expected money!
And that's good, man,
because I bet YOU never
expected a present from ME!"
"112","I've listened to the music
you sent so many times,
I've memorized it! It goes...
doot doot, *record scratch*,
doot doot, ""word I'm not
allowed to say,"" doot doot!"
"113","I went for a walk with
the tool you sent me!
Everyone was staring.
I dunno why. I had it on
a leash and everything!"
"118","Fossils are neat! If you
sleep with one under your
pillow, you'll see dinosaurs
in your dreams!"
"119","A fossil that hasn't been
checked! Oh man, should I
enjoy the mystery, or ask
Blathers to look at it?
What if it's a lame fossil?!
WHAT IF IT'S COOL?!"
"120","I hung the thing you
sent me on my wall,
and it looks great!
It's like it's been there
this whole time!"
"121","Thanks for the present!
It was fun to get a present,
so I'm sending you one too!
Presents for everybody!"
