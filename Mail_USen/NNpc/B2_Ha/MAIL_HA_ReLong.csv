"101","Thanks for the card and the
awesome gift! I can't believe you
went to all that trouble just for me.
I figured I'd return the favor since
you were so thoughtful. Enjoy!"
"102","Wow! You sent me an awesome
letter with an even awesomer gift!
Reading your words lit a fire in my
heart. If I pump iron with the kind
of passion you put into writing, I
bet I'll see some amazing results!"
"103","That was one impressive card you
sent me the other day. Thanks so
much! I was so happy that I just
had to write back right away. But I
didn't know what to write, so take
this gift!"
"104","I got your letter! That was a lot of
words! Reading it felt kind of like
running a marathon, but I'm really
more of a sprinter, so I felt quite a
sense of accomplishment when I
crossed the letter's finish line."
"105","It took a lot of finger muscles to
write such a long letter! I'm
impressed! Now I see you in a
whole new light. Guess I have some
cooooompetition when it coooomes
to wriiiiiting looooong letterrrrrrrrs."
"106","Your long letter showed me that
you have a real strength when it
comes to writing. But it was so long
that I began to worry my eye
muscles would get sore!"
