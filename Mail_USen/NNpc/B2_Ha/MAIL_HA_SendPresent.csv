"101","I was wiping down my workout gear
when I suddenly got the urge to lift
my couch. I call it couch-benching.
Get it? Anyway, long story short, I
found this under my couch. Want
it? Well, it's yours now!"
"102","So I had this dream. I was playing
baseball on the moon and it was
snowing protein powder and the
hoop was made of fish and then I
won and was crowned king of Moon
Muscle City. Anyway, I got you this!"
"103","Did you like school? I didn't. Gym
wasn't hard enough! I tried jumping
ahead to college-level gym class,
but it was still too easy! Guess I'm
just too swole for school! Anyway,
here's to our schooldays."
"104","You like the clothing I sent? I
bought it for myself, but then it got
super-duper MEGA sweaty, and it
wasn't the same when I washed it.
Too much sweat. It looked like your
size though. Just DON'T sniff it!"
"105","Ever think about history? I spent
a while in the wilderness, doing the
workouts my ancestors did, like
lifting trees and swimming upriver
and crushing rocks and stuff. This
came in handy. You want it?"
