"003","What's up, n\0?"
"004","Dear n\0,"
"005","Hey, n\0!"
"006","2\0n\0!"

"009","Gettin' it done, n\0?"

"101","I was wiping down my workout gear
when I suddenly got the urge to lift
my couch. I call it couch-benching.
Get it? Anyway, long story short, I
found this under my couch. Want
it? Well, it's yours now!"
"102","So I had this dream. I was playing
baseball on the moon and it was
snowing protein powder and the
hoop was made of fish and then I
won and was crowned king of Moon
Muscle City. Anyway, I got you this!"
"103","Did you like school? I didn't. Gym
wasn't hard enough! I tried jumping
ahead to college-level gym class,
but it was still too easy! Guess I'm
just too swole for school! Anyway,
here's to our schooldays."
"104","You like the clothing I sent? I
bought it for myself, but then it got
super-duper MEGA sweaty, and it
wasn't the same when I washed it.
Too much sweat. It looked like your
size though. Just DON'T sniff it!"
"105","Ever think about history? I spent
a while in the wilderness, doing the
workouts my ancestors did, like
lifting trees and swimming upriver
and crushing rocks and stuff. This
came in handy. You want it?"
"106","If you REALLY wanna max out your
gains, you gotta change it up—and
I mean both the workouts AND the
scenery. So here's something to
help you with the scenery. Just like
that, you're halfway there!"
"107","Hey, you like mysteries, right?
I found a fossil that's really got me
wondering how much dinosaurs
could deadlift. I'm totally stumped,
so I'm sending it your way. Let me
know what you find out!"
"108","I found this really awesome art
thing when I was out on patrol the
other night. I asked around and
nobody claimed it, so I'm gifting it
to you for all the awesome stuff
you're always doing for us."
"109","Of course you are! And you inspire
me to get it done too! I'm way more
ripped for being your friend. I run
more laps, bench more weight, do
more reps... Long letter short, I got
you a gift to say thanks. Thanks!"
"110","You ever buy something for a
friend, but then get a good workout
rhythm going and then completely
forget to give it to them? Uh...
Me neither. Oh, by the way, your
arms are looking real buff lately!"
