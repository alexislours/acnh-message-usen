"101","What's up, birthday bud? So, I was
doing sprints over by the airport,
and suddenly I remembered I still
needed to send you that birthday
gift from before! Hope it's not TOO
heavy for you. Enjoy!"
"102","What's up? Getting that birthday
bod in buff shape? Here's that gift
I couldn't give you before. I
wrapped it in extra-tough paper
'cause I know how you like to flex
those bonkers-tier biceps!"
"103","Happy birthday! I'm sending along
the present I couldn't give you
before. Also, sorry about the sweat
stains on the card. I accidentally
grabbed this letter instead of my
towel after cardio yesterday..."
"104","Remember those cupcakes from
your birthday bash? Surprise! Well,
probably not too surprising.
Whatever, here you go. Don't scarf
'em all at once, alright? Let's
smash our quads later!"
"105","Here are those birthday cupcakes I
said I was gonna send. My writing
muscles are kind of cramping up
right now and I don't know what
else to say, so now I'm just filling
up space. My fingers hurt."
"106","Here are the cupcakes from your
big day! I almost mistook the box
for a crate full of random free
weights I've been training with this
week. It felt kinda light. Enjoy your
cupcakes!"
"107","Thanks for the cupcake the other
day! I've sent you a birthday gift
that I wasn't able to pass along the
other day. It comes with my wish
that you get super-mega-buff in
the coming year."
"108","Here's the birthday gift I wasn't
able to hand you the other day.
Also thanks for the birthday
cupcake. The sugar rush I got from
it really boosted my next workout.
You're a good bud. Keep in touch!"
"109","Sorry I'm late, but I'm sending you
a birthday present. I swear I didn't
just get something for you at the
last minute because you shared a
cupcake with me. The timing just
worked out that way! Yeah..."
