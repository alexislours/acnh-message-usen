"101","If there's one thing I know nothing
about, it's having a limit to how
much I can lift. It sounds kinda fun!
What's it like? The way you left
that thing behind was like...whoa!
Oh, and by the way, here it is."
"102","Usually I only send packages so
the mail folks can have ultra-heavy
stuff to lift. But this time I sent that
thing you couldn't take with you
the other day, which is only KINDA

pockets were full? Here it is. Also, I
might've done ZĀ biceps curls
with it, so I hope it wasn't fragile!"
