"101","The best coaches are the ones
who can call quick, short plays.
Your quick, short message meant
the world to me. See you in the
arena, bud!"
"102","Even though your message was
short, your feelings really came
across. Also, it was super short, so
I was able to read it all the way to
the end!"
"103","Are short letters all the rage now?
Cool! I accept the challenge! Here
goes! Oh man. I've already written
way too much. You're way better at
this than I am."
"104","The card you sent proves the old
saying, ""Simpler is better."" You put
your thoughts into words, and I'm
impressed. Although, you could
write a bit more next time, if you
want to."
"105","Hey! Friends don't let friends slack
off when it comes to letter writing!
You're not getting a very good
finger workout when you write so
few words. Put your heart muscle
into it next time!"
"106","Your letter was so short, it made
me wonder if there was some sort
of encrypted, hidden message
there. I looked for hours, but I
couldn't crack your code."
