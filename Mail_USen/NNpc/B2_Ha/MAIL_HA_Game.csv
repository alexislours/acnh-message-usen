"101","Our competition got pretty intense
the other day, didn't it? I'm
sending a little prize I wasn't able
to pass along to you at the time.
I hope we can play again one of
these days!"
"102","I got so excited playing that game
with you the other day, I think
I'm STILL sweating from it! Also,
I've sent you the fruit I owe you.
We should play again sometime!"
"103","I really enjoyed our game the other
day. Please take this because, as
they say, ""to Victor go the spoils.""
(Which I think is true whether or
not your name is Victor.) Anyway,
let's play again one of these days."
