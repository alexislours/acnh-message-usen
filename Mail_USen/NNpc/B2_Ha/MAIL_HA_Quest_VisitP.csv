"101","It was awesome hanging out with
you the other day. Your place is so
cozy. It's perfect after a hard day
(and morning and night) of working
out. Rest days are important too!
That's when the best soreness hits."
"102","Thanks for having me over the
other day! I can't stop thinking
about that room I couldn't get in
to. I'm losing sleep over it! What's
in there?! You gotta show me,
'cause I need my muscle sleep!"
"103","Thanks for having me over the
other day. My favorite part was
getting around with all that stuff on
the floor. It's like you have your
own obstacle course! I'm sending
you something to add to it."
"104","Glad I got to see your place the
other day. I got a feel for your
weird style, and I really like it!
I'm sending a gift, and I hope it
suits you."
"105","I have to say I was a little surprised
by your minimalist lifestyle. That
much space is awesome for cardio,
but it made me wonder if you
needed anything, so I'm sending a
gift. Hope you like it!"
"106","Your place is perfectly furnished!
They say, ""Sound life, sound bod,""
and I think you're totally proving
them right, whoever they are. Hope
you enjoy the gift."
"107","Thank you for the other day!
Sometimes I get nervous chilling
at a friend's house with a bunch of
stuff on the walls, but I didn't have
that problem there. Oh, here's a
gift I forgot to give you then."
"108","I never knew you were a collector
of rare items. It makes me wonder
what else I don't know about you!
But I figure a gift is a good way to
tell someone you'd like to know
them better, so here you go!"
"109","You had a lot of expensive stuff in
you home, and it kinda made me
nervous. I was so worried my huge
arms would knock something over!
Anyway, your place is awesome.
I can't wait to hang out again."
"110","I have to be honest. You have a lot
of empty space in your home, and I
really want to run around in it. I've
sent you a little gift, but I swear it
isn't a bribe!"
"111","I love that you have so much stuff
crammed into parts of your home.
It makes it feel like a warehouse
full of mysterious paleontological
finds. Take one more, from one
adventurer to another."
"112","I had fun the other day! You know,
visiting someone else's place really
breaks up the usual routine. It's
like a breath of fresh air, and I'd
like to visit again someday. Until
then, here's a little gift."
