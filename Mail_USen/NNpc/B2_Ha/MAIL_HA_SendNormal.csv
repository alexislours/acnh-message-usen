"001","To stone-abs n\0,"
"002","Yo, n\0!"
"003","To my fitness friend n\0,"
"004","To mega-delts n\0,"
"005","To my worthy rival, n\0!"
"006","Hey, n\0!"
"007","Hope you're good, n\0!"
"008","Keep fightin', n\0,"
"009","My bud n\0,"
"010","Dear n\0,"
"101","Sometimes writing letters is nice
because you can write things that
you might not say out loud in
person. Then again, I say almost
everything out loud."
"102","Check it out! The other day I ran a
triathlon and won a gold medal!
But when I stepped up to the award
podium, I tripped! And then I woke
up. Turns out I was only dreaming."
"103","I thought of a simple way to train
my fingers. By writing letters, I can
correspond with you while giving
my digits a workout at the same
time. My hands are going to be
incredibly muscular!"
"104","There's one thing I'd like to tell
you today, OK? Muscles aren't
built in a day! Intense daily training
is everything! Don't be a slacker!
OK, that's it."
"105","I've decided to share my morning
warm-up routine with you. It's three
sets of ZĀ sit-ups, three sets of
Zā push-ups, and three sets of
ZĂ squats. I usually do way more
than that, but it's a good baseline."
"106","I'm stuck on a workout plateau, so I
decided to try something different:
writing letters. It's the ultimate
type of muscle-confusion program.
My hands have never been so buff,
and it's all thanks to you!"
"107","You're always doing so much for
me, so I wrote this letter to tell you
how much I appreciate you,
n\0. You challenge
me, and I look forward to
continuing our rivalry."
"108","My muscles have been especially
sore lately. But that's a sign that
I'm getting stronger, right? I can't
wait to see how much they've
grown once this soreness is gone."
"109","I thought of an idea where you
have a special day to write a good
friend a letter. I call it, ""Write a
Good Friend a Letter Day."" I'm so
glad I have you to write to!"
"110","Sometimes I hear others talking
about training their brains. But I
have no idea what to lift to work my
brain muscles. I'm kinda worried
I'm gonna fall behind. Help!"
