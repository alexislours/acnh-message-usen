"001","Like flowers, n\0?"
"002","What's up, n\0?"
"003","My fashion-target n\0,"
"004","Guess what, n\0,"
"005","You like furniture, n\0?"
"006","Try this, n\0!"
"007","For you, n\0."
"008","Let's get real, n\0."
"009","My dear n\0,"
"010","Eeek! 2\0n\0!"
"101","So, I totes ordered WAAAAY too
many flower thingies because, you
know, ""more is better."" And I guess
sometimes it is. But not right now.
Because I can't walk in my house
with all the gardening stuff!"
"102","The umbrella I THOUGHT I lost?
Totes in my house ALL OF A
SUDDEN. Like, it must've ran off
and partied while I went and
bought a new one, then showed
back up! Now I'm giving it to you!"
"103","Ohmigosh! Check. This. OUTFIT!
I saw it and thought, ""That would
look FAB on n\0!""
So I bought it for you. Because
everyone should have a fashion
consultant!"
"104","Sometimes, if I'm feeling lonely or
scared of vampires...I'll sleep with
a stuffed toy! So, if you ever freak
out about floor vampires, grab a
fluffy buddy and sleep tight!"
"105","OHMIGOSH! I bought this furniture
because it was totally glam...then I
realized I had no room for it.
You want it?"
"106","I believe it's super important to be
adventurous in fashion, so I got
you this piece because it looks like
something you'd never wear. Since
I can't see your reaction in person,
I'll just assume you love it."
"107","Know what I love about glasses?
How much they change your face!
Wait! That came out wrong. I just
think it would be cool if you looked
like a totally different person.
What I mean is...I give up."
"108","Every outfit needs a centerpiece—
a little pop of color that pulls the
whole thing together. Accessories
really are the workhorses of the
fashion world. Well, accessories
and buttons."
"109","So I've been thinking, and we
should be hanging out way more.
Maybe sending you surprise gifts
isn't the most efficient way to tell
you that, but what can I say? You
deserve extra special treatment."
"110","This is one of my favorite tops of
ALL TIME! It's bold, it's colorful...
it's fashion gold! Just imagining
you in it has me squeaking with
delight. So much so, I gave myself
a headache, n\0!"
