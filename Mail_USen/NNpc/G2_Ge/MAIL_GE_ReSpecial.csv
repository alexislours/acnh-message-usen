Oh! And I got YOU some clothes
that should look fab on you! Try

me... EXCITING! I really want to
go out and show off my EXCITING
new threads! I want to, um, share
the EXCITEMENT? So I got you
some fashion too! EXCITING!"
"104","Thanks SO MUCH for the prezzie!
I've been, you know, thinking about
changing my house's interior. So
you sent that at a super good time!
I want to say thanks, so I got you
something too!"

prezzie, n\0!
You're, like, SO GOOD at interior
decorating! I picked something
out for you too! I hope you like it!"

fun, I got you something for your
house too! I hope you can find
room for it somewhere!"

the furniture! I already had one of
those. I already had one of those.
Now I have two. Now I have two.
Which is cool! Which is cool!
I got you a thing! Just one thing."

ohmigosh)! Anyhoo, I got you
something too! Enjooooooy!"
"109","Thank you so much for the
itty-bitty flower thingies! How do
you figure a whole flower fits
inside such a tiny package? It's
kind of amazing!"
"110","Thank you for the tree (or was it a
bush)! Trees (let's go with trees)
make oxygen! And we breathe
oxygen. And I LIKE breathing.
So this is a great gift!"

Wow. Thank you! I bought a thing
I wanted, then decided I should
get you something too!"
"112","That music you sent me was SO

to thank you for the tunes!"

SO useful! You really can't have
enough of those kinds of...THINGS!
I can really do...STUFF around the
house with this...THING. Oh! I sent
you a thing too! Enjoy!"
"118","2\0n\0, you're the only
person I know who would give
someone a fossil as a prezzie.
AND THAT IS COOL! If I look at
it long enough, it kinda feels like
I'm looking back through time!"
"119","That fossil you sent me (thanks!)
hadn't been appraised yet, so I'm
taking it to \0Blathers\0￿. I bet it's a
dinosaur fossil...WHOA! You know
how birds evolved from dinosaurs?
\0BLATHERS\0￿. IS. A. BIRD. Ohmigosh."
"120","2\0n\0! Thanks for the
prezzie! I slapped it on my wall so
fast! Then I saw I had the exact
same thing already! BUT! I tore it
down and kept yours! Cool, right?
Got you something, B-T-dubs!"
"121","Your prezzie made me SO! HAPPY!
