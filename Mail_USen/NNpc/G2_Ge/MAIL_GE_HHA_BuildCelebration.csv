n\0! You should let
me come over and check your
interior design. I'm sending you a
little congrats prezzie—hope you
love it!"
"102","HIIIIIIII! Congrats on the new room!
Now that you've got new walls and
ceiling and floor, you need stuff to
decorate it all! So here's a prezzie.
It's for you! (I mean, that's obvs,
but it felt like the thing to say?)"

Decorating Palaces on a Budget
that, when you have a bunch of
rooms, you need a bunch of stuff!
I'm sending you some furniture
so you can get your clutter on!"
"104","Your house is two stories? Wow!
That. Is. SO COOL! Hey, can I do
a concert on your roof? I promise
I won't fall off this time! While you
decide, here's a prezzie (not a
bribe) for you! Enjoy!"
