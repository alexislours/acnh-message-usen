"101","Thank you for all of those letters,
and for all of the feverish feelings
crammed into each of them. Plus
gifts?! You're too much. I can't
possibly make it up to you, but at
least I'll give it a try."
"102","I finally finished reading all of
those letters you sent me. Wow!
And those gifts... You're really
something else. I tried to pick out
the perfect thank-you gift for you,
so I hope you really like it."
"103","Wow! You really put all kinds of
feelings out there when you sent
me all those letters. I love it! Not
to mention the lovely gifts... Well, I
can't quite match your generosity,
but hopefully you appreciate this..."
"104","My mailbox was overflowing with
all the fan letters you sent me!
I wish I had time to write a
response to each and every one,
but, well... This one reply is gonna
have to do the trick."
"105","I gotta say, all of the letters you
wrote me really took my breath
away. It's super sweet of you to
spend so much time thinking of
me, and only a little sad!"
"106","There I was, about to open my
mailbox, expecting maybe one or
two letters. Then...BOOM! You
happened! There were...no words.
I guess you had all of 'em.
Anyway, thanks!"
