"001","Dear n\0,"
"002","To the ever-stylish n\0,"
"003","Apologies in advance..."
"004","Guess what, n\0..."
"005","I was thinking, n\0..."
"006","Special delivery for n\0!"
"007","For the one and only n\0,"
"008","Here's the thing, n\0."
"009","Check it out, n\0!"
"010","For the fashionable n\0,"
"101","They say that there's a hat for
every head, and I think I've found
the one for you. I bought it the
instant I saw it, and I knew that I'd
be sending it to you. Can't wait to
see you try it on!"
"102","You know that my style is always
on point, from head to toe. And
sometimes when I see something
that would look good on someone
else, I get it for them. Well, today's
your lucky day!"
"103","I had a weird dream about you last
night, and I wanted to give you
this. But now that I'm writing this
letter, I realize it doesn't make
sense. Well, here's an umbrella.
(It made sense in the dream.)"
"104","It's your lucky day! I was doing a
little shopping when I came across
this spicy number. Not everyone
can pull it off, but I think you've
got the sense of style to give it
a proper home. Enjoy!"
"105","OK, so bear with me here... I was
thinking about how cool you'd look
in something classic, so I actually
went and picked this up for you!
Is that weird? Probably a little, but
it's to your benefit. Enjoy!"
"106","I had the most amazing dream the
other night. You and I co-owned a
very hip housewares boutique
and business was booming. This
was our bestselling item. Should we
make this dream a reality?"
"107","I saw this wallpaper and one word
came to mind: ""n\0.""
It was then followed by ""exquisite,""
""high-class,"" and ""trendsetting.""
The point is, this is more than just
wallpaper. It's a lifestyle."
"108","Last night I was just about to fall
into a deep and dreamless slumber
when it hit me—your floors are all
wrong. I was up all night trying to
pick out the perfect replacement.
Did I succeed? Yes. Yes, I did."
"109","I bet you've never seen art like this
before! Neither have I, which is
why I bought it for you. I'm dying
to know what you think about it,
how it makes you feel, how much
you love it, etc."
"110","A great n\0 once said,
""There is nothing more luxurious
than a rug."" I believe the contents
of this package will prove that to
be true. I'd keep it for myself, but
impeccable taste is worth sharing."
