"101","They say that there's a hat for
every head, and I think I've found
the one for you. I bought it the
instant I saw it, and I knew that I'd
be sending it to you. Can't wait to
see you try it on!"
"102","You know that my style is always
on point, from head to toe. And
sometimes when I see something
that would look good on someone
else, I get it for them. Well, today's
your lucky day!"
"103","I had a weird dream about you last
night, and I wanted to give you
this. But now that I'm writing this
letter, I realize it doesn't make
sense. Well, here's an umbrella.
(It made sense in the dream.)"
"104","It's your lucky day! I was doing a
little shopping when I came across
this spicy number. Not everyone
can pull it off, but I think you've
got the sense of style to give it
a proper home. Enjoy!"
"105","OK, so bear with me here... I was
thinking about how cool you'd look
in something classic, so I actually
went and picked this up for you!
Is that weird? Probably a little, but
it's to your benefit. Enjoy!"
