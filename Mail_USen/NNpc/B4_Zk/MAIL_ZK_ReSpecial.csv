"101","Those clothes you sent me? You
can't see this, but I'm making a
chef's kiss gesture right now. So
good! Well, I can't be outdone, so
I picked out an outfit for you too."
"102","Yo, thank you for that designer
gift! I can't believe you went and
picked it out just for me. Well, I
can't let that favor go unreturned,
can I? Here's a chic little number
for you, amigo."
"103","I just got your present and I can
already imagine what's inside...
A TV-ready outfit for when I make
my small-screen debut, right?
Ha HA! I'm just kidding, but this is
no joke—I got you something too."
"104","Hey, thanks a ton for the gift.
I can't look at it without thinking of
you. That was the idea, right? Well,
allow me to return the favor! Think
fondly of n
\0 when
you look upon this beauty."
"105","Hey, just writing to say thanks for
the furniture. I usually pick my own
stuff out, and it's pretty avant-
garde, but not always the most
comfy. In return, here's something
a little artsy for your collection!"
"106","Yo, that furniture you got me really
blew my mind! It's not something
I would have picked out myself,
but now I can't live without it.
You've gotta let me pay you back
with this hand-selected piece."
"107","Yoooo! Great minds think alike,
am I right? I am, because you
sent me a piece of furniture that
I already own. No worries though.
I'll just live large with two of them.
Ha HA!"
"108","Hey, I had to write to say thanks
for that particularly aromatic gift.
I...was supposed to eat it, right?
I've made that mistake before,
believe me. Anyway, here's a small
gift for you. Don't eat it!"
"109","I got the lovely gift you sent,
compadre. Don't worry. I'll plant
those flowers and water them
with hairspray. Extra firm hold
for strong roots, right? Oh! I got
you something too. Enjoy!"
"110","Whoa. I'm seriously blown away
by the sapling you gave me. That's
a gift that really says something,
you know? Well, I'm putting down
some roots by giving you THIS!
Hope you like it, friend."
"111","Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the
big idea sending me Bells? What
are you trying to say? I mean, I
appreciate the thought, but next
time, just send a tasteful yet
expensive gift. Like this! Ha HA!"
"112","That music you sent me was sick!
I've never heard anything like it.
Was that...a lack of thumping bass
I detected? What a concept! Well,
I got something for you too. I hope
it's just as life changing for you."
"113","That gift you sent me was really...
practical. And I don't mean that
in a bad way. Like, you actually
sent me something that you figured
I could use. It's revolutionary! So,
I got you this. Hope you can use it!"
"118","Aww, you knew I liked vintage stuff,
so you got me an actual fossil.
That's so literal of you! Anyway,
this made a meteor-like impact
on my soul, so I tried to pick out
something good for you too."
"119","I don't know what I expected, but
it definitely wasn't this. And that's
super cool! Nothing like a mystery
package with a mystery gift inside
to get my heart thumping. Now I'll
return the favor. Guess what it is!"
"120","Greetings, my good-taste twin!
I was surprised—but not THAT
surprised—to see that you sent
me something that I already own.
Great minds, eh? Anyway, I got you
something too. Hope you like it!"
"121","Yo! I got your gift, and I could tell
that you really put your heart into
it. So I decided to do the same
for you. I hope you enjoy what I
picked out, but if you don't...it
was just a joke. Ha HA!"
