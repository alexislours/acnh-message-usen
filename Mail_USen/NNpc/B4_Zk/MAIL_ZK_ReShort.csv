"004","To my concise confidante,"

"101","That card you sent me, composed
so tightly with so few words...it
was almost like poetry. Scratch
that—it WAS poetry. I'll be reading
it at an upcoming slam! Here's a
little thank-you for the material."
"102","It's so YOU to send such a
minimalist note with a maximalist
gift. Trust me, even though you
didn't say a lot, I got the message,
and I got you something in return.
Oops! I've already said too much."
"103","Sending a short card with a cool
gift is such a power move. It's like
you're a busy network executive
who really cares about his friends,
but has no time for them. That's
literally my favorite type of person."
"104","Your letter may have been on the
short side, but it was packed with
authentic feelings. That's the kind
of thing that just can't be faked,
no matter how hard I try."
"105","Thank you for the letter. At first
I was a little hung up on how short
it was, but then I realized that you
simply expressed your feelings in
a super efficient way. It inspired
me to try and do the same!"
"106","It took me a while to understand
the point of that short note you
sent me, but then I got it. It's
about what you DIDN'T write, like
the blank space in a painting,
right? Or do I still not get it..."
