"101","Thank you so much for helping me
celebrate my birthday! Your note
and your gift were SO thoughtful
that I had to write you back with
my own little offering. I hope you
like it!"
"102","I can't believe you sent a birthday
card and gift just for me. You
shouldn't have! (Just so there's no
misunderstanding... I'm glad you
did.) It's not much, but I got you a
little something too. Enjoy!"
"103","You helping celebrate my birthday
made me happier than any present!
(To be clear—I still love presents.)
Anyway, you surprised me so much
that now I'm gonna try to surprise
YOU with this gift."
"104","I'm so impressed that you
remembered my birthday AND
had the initiative to send a card
and a present! That's just, like,
super cool. But I guess it makes
sense, because you're super cool."
"105","I'm so psyched that I got a note
from you! It's like, who writes
notes anymore? Classy people
who care, that's who! Anyway,
you're the best, and I'm glad
we're friends."
"106","I feel like the second-coolest kid
in class getting a note from the
coolest kid in class when I read
the note you sent me. I hope this
year is full of great things for you,
because you deserve it."
