"101","Hey, thanks for showing me around
your place earlier! Your interior
design prowess continues to wow
me with each new room you add.
Oh! I almost forgot! I got you a
little something."
"102","Thanks again for the tour of your
casa grande. That's Italian for
cool crib! Anyway, what's up with
the room you had blocked off?
Keeping gifts for n
\0
in there? Well, here's one for you!"
"103","Hey, I just wanted to thank you
again for the tour of your place
earlier. And, uh, to be honest...
I thought you could use something
like this. I'm not telling you how
to live! It's just, like, a suggestion."
"104","It was fun to visit your place, yo!
I'm always interested in seeing the
latest trends in interior design and
your setup really left me with some
questions, friend. Anyway, here's a
quirky gift for a quirky 2guygal."
"105","Hey, I just had to write after seeing
your place. That one room was so
refined, so austere... It was almost
too much! So, I had a brainstorm,
and then I went shopping, and here
we are. I hope you like it!"
"106","I can't believe how cozy your
place was. It was almost like being
a little kid again and coming in
from the snow to a roaring fire
and hot chocolate. So here, I hope
this fits right in with that aesthetic."
"107","You know, a person's home really
tells a lot about them. But your
place? Lips zipped tighter than
my designer jacket! So I got you
a little something to spice up the
vibe in there. Hope you like it!"
"108","Hey, thanks for having me over to
your place. Or should I say...your
MUSEUM! Dude, you've got some
of the rarest pieces I've ever seen!
You HAVE to tell me where you got
those. In return, I'll give you this!"
"109","Yo, talk about house goals...
Your place blew me away! It was
so fancy, so elegant... But mostly,
SO EXPENSIVE! You're living your
best life, and I'm here for it. And
this here is for you!"
"110","You know, I never expected you to
have such a refined sense of
minimalist style. It's really cool!
It's like, the things that AREN'T
there send a message. Anyway, I
hope this gift doesn't clutter it up!"
"111","To be honest, I'm still a little dizzy
after visiting your place. You had
so much...stuff! Now, don't get me
wrong. I love stuff! I super duper
love getting new stuff! But maybe
something like this could help..."
"112","Just wanted to write and say
thanks again for the excellent
tour of your casa! I even got some
ideas for MY casa, so I got you a
little gift as thanks. Let's hang out
again soon, yeah?"
