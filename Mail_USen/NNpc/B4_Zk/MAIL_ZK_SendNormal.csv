"001","Check this out, n\0..."
"002","To my pal n\0,"
"003","My buddy n\0,"
"004","Bonjour, dearest n\0,"
"005","2\0n\0,"
"006","Guess what, n\0..."
"007","Listen up, n\0!"
"008","Calling n\0,"
"009","To my new pal, n\0!"
"010","Dear n\0,"
"101","I was sitting down enjoying a cold
촀 when I suddenly
thought of you. Weird, huh? Were
you drinking 2\0촀 at
the same time? I just had to know,
so I wrote you this letter!"
"102","I had a strange dream about you
last night. You were absolutely
crushing some 촀.
Like, you were tearing into it, just
getting wild. Anyway, I woke up
hungry and decided to write you."
"103","Surprised to get a letter from me
out of the blue like this? Well, it's
just my style to be surprising like
that! Do you even know me at all?
I'm just kidding. BOOM. That's also
my style. n
\0 out!"
"104","You know what's fun? Making
predictions! Like, what will this
island look like in 10 years? Who'll
win Best Hair on 2\0n\0
this year? And who will owe Tom
Nook the most Bells ever?"
"105","You want to know how to write a
great letter to a friend? Just be
straightforward. Tell them all the
things you like about them that
would be too awkward to say in
real life. You're welcome!"
"106","When I close my eyes, I can see
the most beautiful sunset ever.
Ooh, I wish I could show it to you.
The range and depth of colors are
astonishing!
...This isn't helping, is it?"
"107","You know, I thought I was 100% a
city boy, and that moving here
was really gonna cramp my style.
But it turns out that I'm all about
this rustic life! Now if only I could
get a designer fishing pole..."
"108","You know what's a good way to
get to know someone better? Send
them a card! Like this! Let's see,
where to start... Maybe I should tell
you something about me that you
don't know. Oh! I'm out of space..."
"109","Letters are a great medium for
messages that sound super
awkward in person. Like, I'm
really glad I met you and I think
you're a cool person. For the
record, I'm telling you that."
"110","Hey, I just wanted to say that I'm
so happy I met you. I couldn't have
said it in person without getting all
flustered and weird. And now I'm
sure all of our future interactions
will be 100% normal!"
