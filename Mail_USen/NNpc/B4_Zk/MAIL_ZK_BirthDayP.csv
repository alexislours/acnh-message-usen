"001","Dear n\0,"
"002","Salutations, n\0!"
"003","My fair n\0,"
"004","Cheers, n\0!"
"005","Ciao, n\0!"
"006","To the one and only n\0,"

"008","My pal n\0,"
"009","Bonjour, n\0,"
"101","Feliz cumpleaños! That means
you're rad in French! Oh, and
on a separate note... Happy
birthday! Here's that gift I was
gonna give you earlier. I hope
you super love it..."
"102","I just thought I'd send this note
along with the gift that you didn't
have room to carry earlier. I'm sure
this is going to be a big year for
you, in no small part thanks to me!
Ha! Kidding, not kidding."
"103","Once more in written form...
Happy birthday! It was cool to
help you celebrate a new chapter
in your life. Oh yeah, and I even
included a present! Better late
than never, right? Enjoy!"
"104","Recovered from your birthday party
yet? Well, ready or not, here are
the cupcakes you couldn't take
with you. Speaking of recovery,
that piñata will never be the same.
You really showed it who's boss!"
"105","Did you have a good party? I sure
did! Anyway, here are the cupcakes
you got from that piñata. You could
enjoy them all yourself, but I'm sure
you have some friends who would
totally appreciate them too..."
"106","I'm sending you the cupcakes from
your piñata post-haste, because
who likes a stale cupcake? Also,
that pose you struck after crushing
the piñata into smithereens?
Classic n\0."
"107","Just wanted to say thanks for the
cupcake earlier. Were those
homemade? I could just tell that
they were full of love...and maybe
molasses? Anyway, here's the gift
you couldn't carry earlier. Enjoy!"
"108","Thank you so much for sharing
your cupcakes with me earlier.
I feel bad that you couldn't carry
my gift with you, so I'm sending it
with this letter! I picked it out just
for you, so I hope you like it."
"109","It's your lucky day! This package
contains my birthday present for
you. Sorry it's a little late, and I
don't know if it'll measure up to
the cupcake you gave me, but
here's hoping!"
