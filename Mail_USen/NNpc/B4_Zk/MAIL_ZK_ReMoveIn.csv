"101","Thanks for being so nice to me,
especially since I'm new to the
island. You even sent a welcome
gift! Who does that anymore? I'll
tell you who—really cool folks who
are going to be my friends!"
"102","Just writing to say thanks for
sending me that letter and gift.
It's really cool of you to welcome
me to your island like that! I got
you a little something to show off
my n
\0 style!"
"103","Hey, thanks for sending the gift
and card. It really means a lot to
a rookie like me. I already feel like
I belong now, you know? Would you
accept a small gift in return? Too
late—you already did!"
"104","Getting a note from you so soon
after I moved in was really sweet.
Thanks to you, I feel like I already
belong here! I hope I can count
on you to listen to my long, weird
stories attentively."
"105","I hate to admit it, but I was pretty
nervous about moving here. Then
I got that letter from you! That's
such a cool thing to do for a
newcomer like me. Anyway, good to
meet you, and let's hang out soon!"
"106","That card you sent me was really
thoughtful! I guess you must know
what it's like to be a newbie,
because you made me feel right
at home. Now I'm sure I made the
right choice in moving here."
