"101","Alright, this isn't easy to admit,
but you beat me fair and square
in that game. So here are the
fabulous prizes I owe you. Fair
play, and let's do it again soon.
I need to get even!"
"102","Alright, here are the prizes that
you won earlier and couldn't carry
home with you. Eat them, plant
them, do whatever you want—

Savor them, because next time we
play, I'm coming out on top!"
