"101","I'm utterly baffled! The letter you
sent me—it didn't have a single
thing written in it! Did you use
some kind of invisible ink? Is there
a secret code? Perhaps I've
watched too many spy movies."

send a letter with nothing written
in it...and I'm supposed to know
what that means? While I like a
joke as much as the next gal, this
isn't so much funny as it is foolish."
"103","What is the meaning of this letter
with no words in it? Do you mean
to suggest that words are
unnecessary when it comes to a
friendship such as ours? Why, yes!
I see! And I agree wholeheartedly!"
