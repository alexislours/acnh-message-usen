such a delight. You brightened up
my whole day! Now, before I forget,
I'm sending you the gift you
weren't able to carry home. May it
brighten your day in return!"
"102","Did you enjoy your visit to my
house? Next time you come over,
I'll be sure to give the place a
good cleaning beforehand. Oh, and
here's the gift I wanted to give you
earlier. I do hope you enjoy it!"
"103","Thank you for coming over to visit!
I do love to play host. You had your
hands full so I couldn't give you
your present, remember? Well, here
it is. Don't get too excited. It's just
a little something from me to you!"
"104","Thank you again for the lovely
visit. Here is the item I said you
could have but you couldn't carry
at the time. Now, I only sold it with
the understanding that you would
take good care of it. Treat it well!"
