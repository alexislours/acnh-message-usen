"101","While I was reading the short
message you sent to me with your
gift, it struck me—brevity is classy!
So allow me to get to the point.
Thank you for the note and please
enjoy the gift I've sent in return."
"102","It was very classy the way you said
less rather than more in the note
you sent with your gift. If only
more people knew when to do the
same! Anyhoo, I've sent a gift to
thank you. Enjoy!"
"103","What a darling little message you
sent me. So short! Brevity must be
in fashion. I suppose it's so as not
to let words overshadow the gift?
Well, I've sent a gift too, but my
message went on as long as ever!"
"104","Thank you for your letter. It was
much shorter than I expected, so
I read it that many more times!
You mean to say that longer isn't
necessarily better, no? They say
brevity is the soul of wit, after all."
"105","I read your letter. I was terribly
impressed by how you said so
little...yet said so much. Are short
messages popular these days?
Do tell! I must keep up on the
latest trends!"
"106","I received your letter and couldn't
help but smile! So much of your
personality came through despite
it being such a short message. How
DO you do it?! There's much to be
said for simplicity, isn't there?"
"201","With much gratitude, n
