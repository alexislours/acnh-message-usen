"002","2\0n\0, ever mysterious!"
"003","Greetings, dear n\0,"
"004","To my bold friend, n\0!"
"005","2\0n\0, my friend..."
"006","My dear friend, n\0!"
"007","2\0n\0,"
"008","Goodness, n\0!"
"009","What can I say, n\0?"
"010","My little minimalist, n\0,"
"011","Goodness, n\0!"
"012","Thank you, n\0!"
"101","Thank you for letting me visit the
other day! Your home was so
wonderfully, uniquely YOU! Here is
a little token of my gratitude.
It's a little something I thought you
might like based on what I saw."
"102","It was so kind of you to have me
over, darling. I hope you enjoy this
thank-you gift! I also hope that,
someday soon, you let me see
what's inside that secret room of
yours. The suspense is killing me!"
"103","Thank you for having me over. What
a delight it was to see your place.
It was so full of your unique...
n\0-ness! Of course,
things do tend to pile up quickly,
so perhaps you'll find this helpful."
"104","What a delightful visit to your home
that was! I was most intrigued by
your daring furniture arrangements.
So...unorthodox! You do know how
to make a statement, darling.
Now please, take this gift. I insist!"
"105","Your home—what can I say? Thank
you for allowing me to visit. Now,
about that room... So austere!
Like a prison cell...in a monastery.
Darling, even a minimalist such as
yourself needs one of these, yes?"
"106","What a pleasant surprise it was to
visit your home! So comfortable!
So stylish! So YOU! I don't say this
lightly...I was impressed! Here's a
little something for having me over.
Let's do it again soon, shall we?"
"107","I quite enjoyed visiting your home.
But a note—they say the walls of a
house are like the canvas of a
painting. And your canvas, darling,
is empty. So, here! Let's get those
decorative juices flowing, shall we?"
"108","You know me, I just HAD to send a
thank-you gift. It's nothing too
fancy, mind you. You have so many
rare items... How could I compete
with that?! This gift is just a simple
thank-you for having me over."
"109","Your home—it was fabulous! The
very lap of luxury! Thank goodness
green looks good on me, because
I'm the picture of envy. I've sent a
thank-you gift for having me over.
I do hope it meets your standards."
"110","How pleasant it was to visit your
home! Your understated approach
to interior design—so tidy! Though,
I must say, you could use a touch
more furniture, darling. Please, try
filling the empty space with this."
"111","Thank you for having me to your
home. It was quite...something!
Who knew you could fit so many
things in one space! A thought
occurred—perhaps my friend could
use some storage. Try this, darling."
"112","Visiting your home was a pleasure!
As you know, interior design is a
passion of mine, so I loved seeing
what you did with the place. Very
interesting indeed. Now, here's a
little gift from yours truly. Enjoy!"
