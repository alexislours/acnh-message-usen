"101","I had the strangest dream! In it, I
was writing an important letter to
you. Alas, when I awoke, I couldn't
remember what the letter was
about! I guess we'll never know.
Anyhoo, hope this finds you well."
"102","I was out for a stroll when, quite
suddenly, you sprang to my mind.
I had this powerful feeling I should
write you. And so I have! I don't
have much to say, but I do hope
my letter has brightened your day!"
"103","I started writing this message
because I had something to tell
you. But now, all of a sudden, I'm
drawing a complete blank! It's
quite embarrassing, but I shall
send this letter to you anyway!"
"104","I want you to know that you are a
fabulous friend, and I appreciate
you for being you. Sometimes
I forget to say it, darling, but I want
you to know that I think it often.
I am lucky to have you as a friend!"
"105","I just have to tell you about this
FAB dream I had! In it, I became
a world-famous fashion designer.
I was SO popular that celebrities
fought over me! Do you think this
dream foretold my future? Say yes!"
"106","I do enjoy craft projects, don't
you? Focusing oneself on making
something beautiful is a wonderful
stress reliever. And finishing it is
so very fulfilling. The hard part is
deciding which project to start!"
"107","I was about to catch the most
exquisite bug, but it eluded me at
the very last second! I know I
shouldn't give up, but I'm terribly
frustrated! Thank you for letting
me vent, darling. You're the best!"
"108","I'm writing to you because we get
along so well. Also, I wanted to tell
you that I value open and honest
communication. So please, if
anything ever comes to mind, feel
free to talk to me. I'm here for you!"
"109","Do you ever feel down in the
dumps? I certainly do! When
that happens, I like to rearrange
my room. It's refreshing—and
empowering—to reshape the world
around you. Go on! Give it a try!"
"110","Is there anything better than
receiving a letter from someone
out of the blue? I think not! It
makes my heart pitter-patter with
excitement. I hope this letter has
done the same for you!"
