"101","Thank you for the heartfelt birthday
card and lovely present. My own
heart swelled with gratitude upon
their arrival. It may seem a wee bit
backwards, but I insist you accept
this gift in return. Do enjoy!"
"102","I was so happy to get your birthday
card. And a present too—you're so
good at surprises! Here, this is to
thank you. It's nothing fancy, but
after all, it was my birthday, not
yours. You understand, don't you?"
"103","Your birthday card and present
made it to me safe and sound. Your
kindness will linger in my heart for
a long time. Thank you for thinking
of me on my special day. Please,
enjoy this token of my gratitude."
"104","Thank you for the birthday card.
I confess, I do not enjoy growing
older. Not one bit! But I do enjoy
basking in birthday wishes! And at
this very moment, I am basking in
your kind wishes. I hope it shows!"
"105","I was thrilled to receive your card!
My goodness, you remembered my
birthday! What a delight. And here
I wasn't expecting anything at all.
I was so surprised, I screamed a
little—but don't tell anyone!"
"106","I just read the delightful birthday
card you sent me. Thank you for
thinking of me! You know, sending
birthday cards is in vogue again.
I shall keep yours on my mantel
as a showpiece."
