"006","To my classy new neighbor,"
"101","It's real neighborly of you to send
a note so soon after I got here.
I was wonderin' whether the folks
on this island would take to a crank
like me, and at least one did!
Thanks, and I hope you like this."
"102","You sure know how to welcome a
new fella, kiddo. Sendin' me a gift
was downright neighborly! I'm glad
as ever that I moved here, and
that's all thanks to you. Here...
Thought I'd return the favor. Enjoy!"
"103","If this is how you treat everyone
movin' to your island, I'm surprised
the place ain't packed to the gills!
Never had a warmer welcome—and
you even sent me a gift! I want you
to have this here in return. Enjoy!"
"104","What a surprise to get a note like
yours so soon after movin' here!
You sure know how to make an
old grump like me feel welcome!
If everyone else is as nice as you,
I think I'll do just fine livin' here."
"105","Classy move, kiddo, sendin' me a
note like that right when I got here.
This ain't my first rodeo, but movin'
always takes a toll and you've
helped settle my jangly nerves.
I'm feelin' glad I moved here now."
"106","You really caught me off guard with
that note you sent, kiddo. I mean,
here I am, new to the island, and
you're already welcomin' me with
open arms. I'm glad I came here,
and I hope we can get to be pals."
