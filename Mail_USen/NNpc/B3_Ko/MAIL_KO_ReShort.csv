"002","Uh, n\0..."
"003","Well done, n\0."
"004","To the enigmatic n\0,"
"005","Uh, n\0?"
"006","To my mysterious friend,"
"101","So, did you just fire off your note
without finishin' or what? I mean,
I got your gift and I'm grateful, but
I'm dyin' to know what else you
mighta said. Maybe this'll help
loosen up the ol' writer's block?"
"102","Was your note meant to be some
kinda riddle or joke that went way
over my noggin? Is the gift a clue?
Just tell me what I'm supposed to
do next, kiddo! Here, I'll even send
YOU a gift. Now tell me what gives!"
"103","They say that brevity is the soul
of wit or somethin' like that, don't
they? I reckon you were listenin',
so you'd know better'n me. In the
spirit of your letter, I'll stop yakkin'
now and just pass this along."
"104","Your message tickled me, kiddo.
I mean, was it meant to be funny?
Or was there somethin' I missed?
Heh. Always leave 'em wantin'
more—guess you learned that one
early on. Well done!"
"105","So, thanks for the message, but
what's with all that blank space?
Were you tryin' to get all artsy,
playin' with negative space and
whatnot? Well, I don't get it. If you
got somethin' to say, just say it!"
"106","I gotta know. Did you accidentally
send me a grocery list? Or a haiku
in progress? Or some other kinda
nonsense? Because I gotta be
honest—I don't really know what
to do with it, kiddo. Help me out!"
"201","Still curious, n
