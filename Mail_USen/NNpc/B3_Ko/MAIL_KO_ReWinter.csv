"101","Thanks for sendin' along that note
and gift. It's always bittersweet to
leave one year behind and start up
a new one, and your message got
me a little misty. But that's OK—I'm
just happy we're friends."
"102","Everyone's busy at the end of the
year, but you took the time to
send me a real nice message and
gift. That speaks volumes, kiddo.
Here's to another year of bein'
friends. Oh, and I got you this!"
"103","Another year gone in the blink of
an eye, eh? Well, it sure was nice
to close out this one with your
kind note and gift. I got a little
somethin' for you too, but it's not
much. Here's to a new year!"
"104","Thanks a bunch for the card. You
been thinkin' about a New Year's
resolution? Mine's to stay healthy
and build up my strength. Never
know when I might need to show
off and intimidate some kiddos."
"105","Why does the end of the year
always get so crazy? There's never
enough time to get it all done. But
look at you, kiddo! You found the
time to send me that nice card.
Well, you're an inspiration."
"106","Well, that's it for another year.
I really appreciate you takin' the
time to send me a note, 'specially
when things are so busy. I spent
time readin' it instead of cleanin'
up, and I have zero regrets."
