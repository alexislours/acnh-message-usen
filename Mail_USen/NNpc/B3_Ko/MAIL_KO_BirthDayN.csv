"006","Hey, n\0!"
"101","Thanks again for comin' by to help
me celebrate my birthday the other
day. You helped make gettin' older
halfway tolerable. Thanks, kiddo!
Anyway, here's somethin' I got you.
Hope it's the sorta thing you like!"
"102","I gotta thank you again for the gift.
I reckon you do understand the
REAL n
\0—not too
many folks can say that. Anyway,
here's a little somethin' in return.
Figured it was the least I could do!"
"103","Wow! That gift you gave me the
other day really rattled me—in a
good way! Right away I knew I had
to rush out to find somethin' you'd
like just as much. Here it is...
Be sure to let me know how I did!"
"104","Sure was nice to spend my big day
with a cool kiddo like you. And you
even got me a gift! I take back any
bad stuff I've ever said about you.
Plus here's the cherry on top—
I got you somethin' too!"
"105","Thanks for everythin' the other
day. I grin like an idiot every time
I look at that gift you got for me.
Heh. Well, I got you somethin' in
return. I hope it gives you lotsa
grins of your own. Enjoy, kiddo!"
"106","I just had to write and say thanks
again for celebratin' my big day
with me. Oh, and...I got you a little
somethin'. I had to send it with this
letter because I might've gotten all
misty handin' it to you in person."
