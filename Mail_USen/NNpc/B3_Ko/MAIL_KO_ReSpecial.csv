"002","Hullo, n\0!"
"003","To my stylin' friend n\0,"
"004","My thoughtful pal n\0,"
"005","Hullo there, n\0..."
"006","To my new interior designer,"
"007","To my insightful pal n\0,"
"008","To my foodie friend, n\0,"
"009","To my botanist buddy,"
"010","To a green-gift giver,"
"011","Hey now, n\0..."
"012","Dear DJ n\0,"
"013","Hullo, n\0!"
"014","Whoa there, n\0!"
"018","Hullo there, n\0..."
"019","To my fossil-finding friend,"
"020","Sorry, kiddo..."
"021","Hey, n\0!"
"101","Pretty bold to send a piece of
clothin' along as a gift, kiddo!
Confidence and style go together,
so I guess you know what you're
doin'. I tried pickin' somethin' out
for you too, and hope you like it!"
"102","Thanks for the threads, kiddo!
I never know what's in style these
days, so I appreciate you takin' the
time to help me out. Shoot, left to
my own devices, who knows WHAT
I'd wear! Hope you never find out..."
"103","Really appreciate the gift you sent!
Last time I tried to pick out my own
clothes, it ended in laughter and
tears. I won't say whose. Anyhow,
I tried to pick out somethin' nice
for you too. Hope I did OK!"
"104","Just wanted to say thanks for the
new piece of furniture! My place
needed some freshenin' up! Now
I'm sendin' YOU a little somethin'
from my collection. It's probably so
out of style that it's back IN style."
"105","Thanks for tryin' to liven up my
place with that furniture. It's now
the coolest and youngest item in
my place by about four decades!
Got you somethin' too. Maybe not
as cool, but it's definitely from me."
"106","I gotta say thanks for the furniture
you sent me, kiddo. I'm gonna take
real good care of it too. Most of
the other decor in my place is just
stuff I found dumped along the
highway, so yours is extra special."
"107","So, I really appreciate the thought
you put into that furniture you sent
over, but it turns out I already own
somethin' just like it! At least you
know what I like! Hope you don't
already have what I'm sendin' you!"
"108","Thanks for the gift you sent the
other day. I'll never turn up my
nose at somethin' tasty like that.
Well, I'm sendin' along a little
somethin' in return, in hopes you
check your mailbox just as often."
"109","Just writin' to say thanks for the
gift you sent me, kiddo. Most folks
wouldn't have figured me for a
green thumb, but you knew better!
And speakin' of growin', I'm hopin'
this gift grows our friendship too!"
"110","It's funny, kiddo. Normally I'd laugh
at someone sendin' me a live plant
that I gotta take care of. But you?
You somehow knew I was growin'
personally. Get it? Growin'? Like
the plant? Ah, just take this."
"111","I might not be the most ""polite""
guy around, but even I know that
you don't send straight up Bells
as a gift! Now, I'm gonna accept
'em and send you somethin' back,
but don't let it happen again!"
"112","It's real artsy of you to send me
some music as a gift. I've been
listenin' to it on repeat, and I think
of you every time. So I did my best
to pick out somethin' thoughtful for
you. Hope you like it!"
"113","Thanks for givin' me that backup
tool, kiddo. Now I don't have to
worry about breakin' the one I
have! It's that kinda thoughtfulness
that sets you apart. Well, I hope
you like what I got you."
"114","I don't know much about fine art,
but I can tell that thing you got
me is real expensive and real
authentic. In other words, it's real!
Can't make the same guarantee for
what I got you, but it FEELS real."
"118","Thanks for sendin' me the fossil,
kiddo. It's pretty weird to think
that this thing was a part of some
creature that's even older'n I am!
I got you a little somethin' in
return, so I hope you like it."
"119","I thought you sent me a brick, but
then I realized the truth—you sent
me a super OLD brick! Jokes aside,
you should get these things
assessed, kiddo. Well, thanks
anyway and I hope you like this."
"120","Truth be told, I already had one of
those fancy wall-hangin' thingies
that you sent me. But this one is
newer than the old one, so up it
went! Now, go ahead and hang this
on YOUR wall...if that makes sense."
"121","You really went above and beyond
with that gift, so I just had to write
and letcha know. Also, I tried to
pick out somethin' special for you
too, but I don't think I'm as good
at that as you are. Guess we'll see!"
