"001","My pal n\0,"
"002","Dear n\0,"
"003","To our birthday star n\0,"
"004","To my older and wiser pal,"
"005","Yo, n\0!"
"006","To big-shot n\0,"
"007","Dear kiddo,"
"008","To the big-hearted n\0,"
"009","Hi there, n\0!"
"101","I was just writin' to say that I had
a real good time at your party.
Oh—here's that gift you couldn't
carry home. You're a good egg,
kiddo, so I just know this year's
gonna be a great one for you!"
"102","Here's that gift that I couldn't give
you earlier. I just had to make sure
you got it, because I knew this gift
had your name all over it. The first
time I saw it, I thought, ""This needs
to be in n\0's life!"""
"103","I wish every day was your birthday,
if only to help me forget how old
I'm gettin' to be. Anyway, here's
that gift you couldn't carry home
with you. Now go on and have the
best year of your life, understood?"
"104","Almost forgot to send along your
cupcakes. Hope they ain't stale by
now. Baked goods aside, I had a
real fun time at your party, kiddo.
I'm glad to see you young folks still
know how to cut loose these days."
"105","That sure was a fun party, huh?
Oh, here are those cupcakes...
Hope they make it to you without
gettin' messed up. I bet folks who
couldn't make the party would love
one, even if it's kinda smushed."
"106","I don't remember much about your
shindig, maybe 'cause I'm older'n a
tree or maybe 'cause I had so much
fun! Anyway, here are the cupcakes
from your piñata. Remember, it ain't
a bad idea to share these around..."
"107","It warmed my crusty old heart
when you offered me a cupcake
at your party. So I didn't want to
let this gift slip through the cracks.
Hope you like it, but if you don't,
you know what to do... Re-gift it!"
"108","Just wanted to say thanks for the
cupcake, kiddo. I feel bad that I
couldn't give this to you earlier,
but hopefully it's better late than
never. Here's to a great new
chapter in your life!"
"109","That was a tasty cupcake you gave
me. Definitely in the top five I've
had this month. Anyway, here's that
gift I tried to give you. Hope you
weren't just bein' polite about your
hands bein' too full to carry it..."
