"101","Just wanted to let you know that I
really dug that novel you sent me.
Gahaha! Just joshin' with you. It's
rare for someone to take the time
to express themselves like you did,
and I got you this in return. Enjoy!"
"102","So I just finished readin' that book
you wrote. Seriously, it's nice to
have someone send me a note
that actually means somethin'.
Thanks for makin' an effort, kiddo.
Here's somethin' in return. Enjoy!"
"103","Thanks for the note, kiddo. Well,
it was more like a novella, if we're
bein' real. I could feel the emotion
from each page, and the gift was a
nice bonus. I figure you deserve a
response in kind, so here you go."
"104","I read every single word in your
long letter, and appreciated all of
it, even the spaces! Writin' letters
is a bit of a lost art these days,
so I really hope you stick with it!
It sure meant a lot to me, kiddo."
"105","Wow, that was a good, long read!
And a real page-turner too—kept
me up half the night! Well, I can't
let your message go unanswered,
so here we are. I hope my words
are half as inspirin' as yours were."
"106","Oh. My. 2\0촀! (Is
that what you kids are sayin'
these days?) That note you sent
me really rocked my noggin. I'll
read as many as you want to send,
kiddo, so keep 'em comin'!"
