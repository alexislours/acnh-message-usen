"101","Thanks for sendin' that nice card
and birthday present. You really
went above and beyond, kiddo!
I didn't think they taught manners
anymore. Anyway, I got you a little
somethin' too. Hope you like it."
"102","I just wanted to write to say thanks
for the birthday present. Don't tell
anyone, but you warmed my heart.
Gotta keep up my grouchy image!
Anyway, I got you a little somethin'
in return. You're the best, kiddo!"
"103","I was so surprised to get your
note and gift that I fell right outta
my chair! Well, after dustin' myself
off, I went out and got this by way
of thanks. You really know how to
warm an old crank's heart, kiddo."
"104","Thanks a bunch for sendin' that
card for my birthday. You'd think
I'd be tired of celebratin' 'em, but
a day that's all about yours truly
never gets old! I appreciate your
gesture, kiddo. You're a good egg!"
"105","I really appreciate the card you
sent me for my birthday. You really
knocked me for a loop with that!
I might not be one for surprises,
but you sure did make my day.
Thanks a whole heap, kiddo!"
"106","I'm not the kinda guy who wants
folks to sing him a song in a
restaurant on his birthday. Might
even storm outta the place if that
ever happened. But your card was
real tasteful and touching. Thanks!"
