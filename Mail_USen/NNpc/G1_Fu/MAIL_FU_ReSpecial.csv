"002","Dear n\0,"
"003","How'd you do it, n\0?"
"004","To n\0,"
"005","My good friend n\0,"
"006","So tell me, n\0..."
"007","To n\0,"
"008","Hi, n\0!"
"009","You're sweet, n\0!"
"010","To n\0,"

"019","To the amazing n\0,"
"020","To n\0,"
"021","Thanks, n\0!"
"101","Thanks so much for the gift. How
were you able to guess my size?
Seems like you must know me even
better than I thought you did! I'm
returning the favor with something
I think should look good on you."
"102","I love wearing what you sent me,
so I thought I'd try picking out a
little something for you. Can you
believe we're actually exchanging
clothes now? We've reached an
exciting new level of friendship!"
"103","I was so impressed that you were
able to find something that looks
great on me. Thank you so much!
I'm not sure I was as successful,
but let me know what you think
after you try this on for size."
"104","Thank you for the unexpected gift!
You really have great taste in home
furnishings! I'm enclosing a little
something that I hope will look as
good in your place. I'd love for you
to share decorating tips sometime."
"105","You sent something for my home,
so I'm returning the favor. Hey,
swapping furnishings like this is
kind of fun, isn't it? I hope we can
keep on doing this, because you
have really great decorating ideas!"
"106","How were you able to guess the
exact thing I'd been thinking about
getting for my home? Are you some
kind of mind reader? I picked out
something to thank you, but I don't
know that I read your mind as well."
"107","You did a great job picking out
the kind of furniture I would like,
because you sent me something
I already have! I appreciate your
gesture, and I'm sending you
something in return. Thank you!"
"108","I noticed how good your present
smelled before I'd even had a
chance to unwrap it. What a treat!
Thank you so much. I tried to pick
out a gift as delectable as yours,
so I hope this is up to your taste."
"109","Thank you for the lovely gift!
I haven't planted them because
I'm trying to learn everything
about that species before I do.
They've inspired lots of flowery
daydreaming in the meantime!"
"110","I really love this adorable little
seedling that you sent me! I've
been pampering it indoors, but
I guess I should probably pick a
place to plant it outside before
it's too big to fit through my door."
"111","It's always nice to get mail, but
I really appreciated your generous
gift! You really shouldn't have…
Still, I thought I should return the
gesture and pick out a gift for you.
Hope this is something you'll like."
"112","This music you sent me is really
catchy! I've been listening to it
since I got your mail. You inspired
me to send you some music that
I like, and see if you have similar
taste. Let me know what you think!"
"113","Thank you for sending me such a
practical gift! What a great idea.
I'll definitely think of you every
time that I use this! Here—I picked
out a little something for you as
well, to show my appreciation."
"118","This fossil you sent me is great!
It has me imagining what it would
have been like to see this island
in its prehistoric past. I'm sending
back a little something for you,
but my present is from this era."
"119","I tried to guess what you could've
sent me that would be so heavy,
but I never came close to guessing
""freshly dug-up fossil!"" You really
come up with unique gift ideas!
I hope you like what I sent you."
"120","Thanks for the gift! Did you know
I have something like this hanging
in my home right now? They do say
that you can never have too much
of a good thing! I picked this out
for you in return. Hope you like it!"
"121","Your gift was such a nice surprise!
I've been trying to find the best
way to thank you for it, and this is
what I chose to send you in return.
Do you like it? It's so fun to have
someone I can trade gifts with!"
