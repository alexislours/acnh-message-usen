"101","I had fun playing High Card, Low
Card with you. Here's that fruit I
couldn't give you then... I wanted
to make sure you got your winnings
delivered to you. Let's try to play
together again soon, OK?"
"102","Here's your prize from our recent
game of High Card, Low Card. Hope
you had fun playing, because I did.
You really challenged me and made
things interesting! What would you
say to a re-match sometime soon?"
"103","I'm sending along your winnings
from our recent game of High Card,
Low Card. What'll you do with this
fruit, I wonder? I think I might've
baked something with it if I'd won.
Maybe some kind of pie or a tart?"
"201","Enjoy your winnings. n
