"101","Thanks for stopping in for a visit
the other day. I just wanted to send
along this small gift that you had to
leave behind then. Hope you like it.
And I hope you know that you're
welcome to visit me again anytime!"
"102","Your visit the other day was a nice
surprise. I'm glad you got to see
where I live. Oh, that reminds me!
Here's that gift I'd meant to send
home with you. You weren't able to
carry it then, remember?"
"103","I'm sending along the gift that I
wasn't able to send home with you
when you came by to visit me. It's
great having some extra motivation
to keep up with my housecleaning,
so feel free to stop by anytime!"
"104","Do you remember what I said you
could have when you came by to
visit? You couldn't take it with you
then, so here it is as promised! I'm
looking forward to seeing how you
decide to use what I've enclosed."
