"006","To the amazing n\0,"
"101","Thank you for your gift, and for the
thoughtful message you included.
You expressed yourself so well!
I wanted to return the favor, and
let you know how grateful I am for
your friendship. You're the best!"
"102","I can't tell you how touched I was
by your gift and the heartfelt note
you sent with it. You're so good to
me! I've enclosed a little something
for you to show my appreciation
for your friendship. Thanks again!"
"103","I could already tell that you'd put
a lot of thought into the gift you
sent me, even before I had a
chance to read your nice note.
I felt like the least I could do was
send you this small gift in return."
"104","Thank you for reaching out with
such a thoughtful note when you
did. It came at just the right time
to cheer me up. How do you always
seem to know just the right thing
to say to make me feel better?"
"105","When I read your note, I wasn't
sure at first how to respond.
You'd obviously put so much care
and thought into your words. How
could I ever hope to do as well
in return? You're an inspiration."
"106","It's great to have such a caring
and expressive pen pal as you!
I'm trying to learn from your
example, and do a better job of
sharing my thoughts. Please let
me know how you think I'm doing!"
