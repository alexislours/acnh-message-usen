"003","2\0n\0, just between us..."
"004","Get this, n\0..."
"005","2\0n\0, what do you think?"

"101","Chores are boring and repetitive,
but when I'm busy scrubbing away
around my home, it's almost like a
break. For a little while, I can get
something accomplished without
having to worry about anything."
"102","I've always dreamed about living
inside a library… I picture myself
surrounded by shelf after shelf of
books, stacked up to the ceiling!
In a home like that, it's possible
I'd never run out reading material!"
"103","Recently, I spotted an envelope on
the ground. I thought that there
might've been a love letter inside,
but it wasn't addressed to or from
anyone. I peeked inside, and the
envelope turned out to be empty!"
"104","Yesterday I wore myself out, so I
decided to sleep in and spend the
whole morning lying around in bed.
But I still woke up at the usual time
today, like I just couldn't wait to
wear myself out all over again."
"105","If I wanted to write up my work
history, like for a resume, what
could I even say I was good at?
Who'd want to hire someone with
experience in baking and reading?
Are there cookbook researchers?"
"106","I was out for a walk on the beach
just now when I remembered a
funny thing you said once, and
it made me smile all over again.
I thought you should know that,
so that's why I sent you this note."
"107","What are you up to right now?
Something fun, I bet. You always
have the greatest ideas. So I was
thinking of you, and I guess I'm
writing to ask if we can plan to
do something together soon..."
"108","OK, so this might sound strange,
but whenever I see numbers lining
up, I get excited. Like, if I happen
to look at my clock just as the time
flips over to 11:11, I feel like that
might be important, somehow..."
"109","Sometimes I like just being alone,
but there is such a thing as too
much of a good thing. Eventually
the quiet gets to me, and I need
some company. That was a hint, by
the way, in case you didn't notice..."
"110","I've been told so many times that
I ""take things too seriously,"" so
I'm gonna really try to loosen up.
From now on, I'm going to be more
spontaneous, less stuck on rules
and recipes. I'm serious! Oh…"
