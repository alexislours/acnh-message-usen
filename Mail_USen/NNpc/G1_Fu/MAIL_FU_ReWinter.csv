a gift to mark the end of the year!
I want to wish you a happy holiday
season as well with this present.
Isn't it fun exchanging gifts like
this? Best wishes for next year!"

for you as well, so I'll send it with
this. I hope your next year is full
of fun times with good friends!"

time to reach out, and I wanted
to tell you I'm glad we're friends."

heart like a nice hot cup of tea.
In the coming new year, here's
hoping that we'll keep exchanging
notes and finding fun ways to
spend time together."
