"101","I'm sending you the gift that you
couldn't carry home from the party.
We had a hard time deciding what
we should get for you, so here's
hoping we chose well and you like
it. Best wishes for your next year!"
"102","Here's that gift that you weren't
able to carry home with you the
other day. Hope you like it! While
I've got your attention, can I sneak
in one last happy birthday wish?
It was great to celebrate with you!"
"103","Happy birthday, n\0!
Here's that present you've been
waiting for, the one you couldn't
take home from the party. I know
I speak for everyone when I say
I hope you had a really great day!"
"104","What a fun birthday party! I wanted
to make sure your cupcakes got to
you as soon as possible, since you
weren't able to take them with you.
There are a lot, so you may want
to share them around with friends."
"105","Did you have fun at your party?
I'm so glad I was there to celebrate
with you! I'm sending along those
birthday cupcakes from the piñata,
the ones you couldn't carry home.
Share them while they're fresh!"
"106","Wasn't that a great birthday party?
I'm sending along these cupcakes
now before I forget. I think they
came out pretty tasty—hope you
agree! I bet you'd make even more
friends if you shared these around."
"107","Thanks for sharing one of your
cupcakes with me. I wanted to
make sure you got this present
that I couldn't give you before.
I said this already, but I hope
you had a very happy birthday!"
"108","It was a really nice gesture for you
to share one of your cupcakes with
me. I wanted to give you this gift
then, but you weren't able to carry
it home. I hope you like it, and that
you had a really great birthday!"
"109","Thank you so much for sharing one
of your cupcakes with me recently.
You couldn't take this gift home
with you at the time, but I wanted
to make sure you got something
from me for your birthday. Enjoy!"
