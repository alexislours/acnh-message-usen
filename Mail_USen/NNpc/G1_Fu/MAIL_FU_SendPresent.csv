"004","So, n\0, I was thinking..."
"005","What do you think, n\0?"
"101","One of my favorite things to do is
to relax at home and sip a nice, hot
beverage. I thought I might send
something to help you do the same.
Now your home can feel like a café!
I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."
"102","Even if you've already got a clock,
I thought you might like another.
I like to keep two clocks around,
myself. It gives me peace of mind,
since at least one is bound to keep
telling time even if the other stops."
"103","I can't resist buying anything that
makes my home feel like a library.
The problem is that sometimes I'll
mess up and buy things I already
own. Would you be willing to take
this so I don't have to feel silly?"
"104","I saw something in the store that I
liked, but I thought it would look so
much better on you. I went ahead
and bought this because I want to
see if I'm right. If you do like it, I'd
love to have you model it for me."
"105","I'm obsessed with cooking, so I'm
picky about what I keep around to
cook with. I recently did a bit of a
kitchen update, and wondered if
this was something you could use?
I hope you love it as much as I did."
