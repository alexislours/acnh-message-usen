"001","Dear n\0,"
"002","Hear me out, n\0..."
"003","Between us two, n\0,"
"004","So, n\0, I was thinking..."
"005","What do you think, n\0?"
"006","Sharing is caring, n\0!"
"007","Something for n\0:"
"008","Dear n\0,"
"009","To the always-fresh n\0,"
"010","2\0n\0, I've been thinking..."
"101","One of my favorite things to do is
to relax at home and sip a nice, hot
beverage. I thought I might send
something to help you do the same.
Now your home can feel like a café!
I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."
"102","Even if you've already got a clock,
I thought you might like another.
I like to keep two clocks around,
myself. It gives me peace of mind,
since at least one is bound to keep
telling time even if the other stops."
"103","I can't resist buying anything that
makes my home feel like a library.
The problem is that sometimes I'll
mess up and buy things I already
own. Would you be willing to take
this so I don't have to feel silly?"
"104","I saw something in the store that I
liked, but I thought it would look so
much better on you. I went ahead
and bought this because I want to
see if I'm right. If you do like it, I'd
love to have you model it for me."
"105","I'm obsessed with cooking, so I'm
picky about what I keep around to
cook with. I recently did a bit of a
kitchen update, and wondered if
this was something you could use?
I hope you love it as much as I did."
"106","I was doing a little recreational
organizing last weekend and came
across this light. It's just gathering
dust here, but I thought it might
brighten up your place. I hope you
like it! If not...well, sorry."
"107","Surprise! It's a rug! I read a short
story about a flying carpet recently
and bought this in a moment of
literary impulse—my biggest vice.
No, the rug can't fly. But it can be
the backbone of great home decor."
"108","Giving a gift in person can feel so
casual. Sending this item via snail
mail seemed more appropriate
somehow. What's more charming
than a well-wrapped package? The
handpicked gift inside, I hope!"
"109","I've been waiting for the perfect
moment to send you a surprise
present. I picked this out for you
after hemming and hawing for five
hours. I really, really hope you like
it. If not, please don't tell me."
"110","We could take our friendship to the
next level if we had a shared
interest. You know I have a weak
spot for handicrafts. This gift
is my best attempt to convert you
to my craft-happy ways."
