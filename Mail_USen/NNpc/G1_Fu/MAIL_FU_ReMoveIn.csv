"101","I was nervous about moving to this
island, but your gift made me feel
so welcome! I want you to know
how grateful I am for your sweet
gesture, and I hope you'll accept
this present from me in return."
"102","Thank you for your welcome gift!
Is it that obvious that I'm still not
totally settled in here? Either way,
that was really thoughtful of you.
I'm enclosing something for you
so I can return your kindness."
"103","Your thoughtful gift made me feel
so welcome here on this island!
I feel a lot less unsettled now, and
that's all thanks to you. I hope
you'll let me give you this present
in return to show my appreciation."
"104","Even though I've barely moved in
here, I already have a note from
you to make me feel welcome!
I'm really grateful that you wrote
to me. I just hope everyone else
feels like I'm that approachable!"
"105","There's so much to get used to
after moving to a new place.
Your note made me feel that, for
the first time, this really is going
to be my home. I hope this means
the two of us will be good friends!"
"106","It was so sweet of you to send me
a note welcoming me to my new
home! If everyone else here is as
kind as you, I'm sure I'm going to
love this place! I can't wait to get
to know everyone on the island!"
