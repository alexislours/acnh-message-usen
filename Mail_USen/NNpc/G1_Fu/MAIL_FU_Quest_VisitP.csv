"012","Dear n\0,"
"101","It was great of you to have me over
the other day. I feel like seeing the
way you've set your place up gave
me lots of decorating ideas for my
own home. I want to give you this
gift as my way of saying thanks."
"102","This is probably rude, but I've been
dying to ask why part of your home
is blocked off. I just love mysteries!
I enclosed this as a thank-you for
letting me visit, but maybe it should
be more of a ""forgive me"" gift now?"
"103","I had a good time at your place the
other day. I wanted to send along
a thank-you gift, and thought you
might be interested in this storage
solution that I found while I was
working to declutter my own place."
"104","Is there a hidden reason why you
faced furniture in toward the wall?
Sorry… I've been trying to puzzle it
out since I stopped by to visit you.
Speaking of that, here's a little gift
to thank you for having me over."
"105","Thanks for welcoming me into your
home. I hope you'll let me stop by
again sometime. I wanted to thank
you by giving you something I don't
think you own yet. Here's hoping
you get some good use out of this."
"106","I liked getting a chance to visit and
see your home the other day. You
have a nice place, and seem very
comfortable in it. I picked up this
small gift to thank you for having
me over to visit. Hope you like it."
"107","Thanks for the other day. It was so
nice of you to host me for a visit.
I wanted to give you a thank-you
gift, and remembered some space
on your wall where this might look
good. Is this something you'd like?"
"108","It was so nice of you to let me visit!
I already knew you were someone
with great taste, but now that I've
seen your collection of rare items,
it's a little intimidating to choose
the right thank-you gift to give you."
"109","Your place is so stylish and filled
with such fancy furnishings! I'm not
sure I've ever been in a home that
nice before. This isn't much, but
I hope you'll accept this thank-you
gift for making me feel welcome."
"110","I really liked getting a look inside
your home. I saw that you still had
some space to furnish, so I thought
I'd thank you for hosting me with
this gift. Nothing would make me
happier than hearing I chose well."
"111","You're lucky to live in a place like
yours, surrounded by so many fun
things you love. I want to thank you
for sharing your home with me with
this small gift. Hope you can find
the perfect spot for it somewhere!"
"112","I had so much fun visiting you the
other day! It means a lot that you'd
open up your home to me. I picked
out this little something to thank
you for allowing me into your life
the way you have. You're the best!"
