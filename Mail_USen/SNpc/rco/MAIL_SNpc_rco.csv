"005","Update from Resident Services!"
"101","We've completed the expansion of
your lovely home. However, during
construction, we had to place one
or more wall-hanging items in your
storage. Hope you understand."
"102","I appreciate how you've helped
prepare homes for new island
residents. As a thank-you gift, I've
included some fencing for your
home. Good fences make good
neighbors, after all!"
"103","A new resident moved to a plot you
set up! As a small token of our
appreciation, we've put 1,000 Nook
Miles into your account. We hope
you spend them on something that
makes you happy."
"104","Oh my! I'm feeling the music! So
glad you came to K.K.'s concert.
His memorable song Everyone's
New Horizon is my gift to you. Pop
it into an item that can play music,
and enjoy it whenever you like!"
"105","To celebrate the opening of the
new Resident Services building, we
have lots of new miles-redemption
items available. Plus, we now have
a new service for Nook Miles+ folks
to earn five times more miles!"
"201","Sincerely, your friends at Nook Inc."

"205","A commemorative gift is attached."
