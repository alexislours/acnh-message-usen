"003","Dear n\0,"
"004","Hey, n\0!"
"005","Ahoy there, n\0!"
"006","Hey, sailor savior!"
"101","Thanks for helping me escape your
quaint island of n""\0!
A literal lifesaver like you deserves
a reward, so please accept this
souvenir from my travels. See you
soon, probably! (Check the beach.)"
"102","I wanted to thank you for saving my
life, but I never got your number!
I hope regular mail is OK. (Did you
know people still do these? Wild!)
Anyway, please enjoy this weird
souvenir from me. Thanks again!"
"103","Here's a little gift to thank you for
all your help! I'm supposed to be
steering the ship right now, but I
had to write this before I forgot.
Anyway, I see a big rock up ahead,
so I'd better wrap this up. Bye!"
"104","Hey! It's Gulliver! (Spoiler warning
for the end of this letter.) Please
accept this gift as a big ol'
thank-you for savin' me! It probably
had a more peaceful voyage to
your island than I did. I'm jealous."
"105","Thanks to your help, I'm back with
my crew! They made a big show of
sighing and rolling their eyes when
I climbed aboard. What jokers!
Anyhoo, here's a cool trinket from
my travels. Hope you enjoy it!"
"106","I've been doing some friend math
and WOW, you've helped me out a
LOT since we met! Like, really an
incredible amount. You deserve
this crazy-rare 2\0Ā촃golden shovel DIY
recipe as thanks. So...thanks!"
