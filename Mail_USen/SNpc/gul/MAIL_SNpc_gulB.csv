"101","HAR! Ye saved me feathery hide!
I owe ye me life, so I'm sendin'
over a bit o' me booty. Remember—
though we may be far apart, we're
always connected by the open sea.
Ugh! Ye got me soundin' all mushy!"
"102","At last, I'm reunited with me crew!
These sea dogs would surely be
sunk without their beloved captain.
I've sent ye some pirate booty as
a reward. Promise you'll gaze at it
often and spare a thought for me!"
"103","We did it, skipper! We beat the
briny deep! I'm back on me ship,
and the jolly is back in me roger.
A good captain repays his debts,
so here's a bit o' booty. Keep an
unpatched eye on it for me! HAR!"
"104","Arr, it's good to be reunited with
these mangy scalawags I call me
crew. Since ye saved me scraggly
neck, I want ye to have a special
reward. It's the bootiest of all me
pirate booty! HAR!"
"105","Thanks to ye, I'm back to sailin'
with me buccaneer buddies. As a
reward, this rare pirate booty is all
yours. I also promise not to pillage
yer fair isle o' n	\0...
even though I really want to! HAR!"
