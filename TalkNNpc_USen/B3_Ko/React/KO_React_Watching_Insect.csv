"002","(촀\0I've been meanin' to make myself
more intimidatin'. Bet I could learn
a thing or two from this 2\0Ā촃giant stag."
"003","(촀\0Someday I'd like to have teeth like
this here 2\0Ā촃saw stag. Except, you

"004","(촀\0That there 2\0Ā촃horned hercules is quite
the looker!"
"005","(촀\0Seems that 2\0Ā촃mantis has got a nice,
wholesome thing goin'. Good for it!"
"006","(촀\0The 2\0Ā촃Madagascan sunset moth's got
a bit too much jazz on those flappers
for my tastes!"
"007","(촀\0That's a splendid shade of silver on
that 2\0Ā촃scarab beetle. Very easy on
the eyes."
"008","(촀\0There's a sight! How'd this
2\0Ā촃great purple emperor get
to lookin' so dignified?"
"009","(촀\0Hey, 2\0Ā촃jewel beetle! You gonna pick a

"011","(9촀\0Too spangly, 2\0Ȁ촃emperor butterfly.
Far too spangly."
"012","(촀\0You kids got it too good nown\0\0 Why,
when I was your age, we had to read
our school primers by 2\0Ā촃firefly light!"
"013","( 촀\0They call this thing an 2\0Ȁ촃Atlas moth,
but that seems a bit ambitious to
me. I'm just gonna call it ""Mappy""!"
"014","(:촀\0I'm told my noggin's fairly large,
but the 2\0Ā촃Queen Alexandra's birdwing
is somehow even bigger!"
"015","(:촀\0You can put the tail down, Mr. 
2\0Ā촃Scorpion. You ain't gotta prove
anything to me."
"016","(9촀\02\0Ā촃Wasps and I are kindred spirits.

Just let us about our business,

"017","(촀\0How's a fella supposed to tell it's
a 2\0Ā촃firefly

"018","(촀\0Y'know, a friend I used to have once

"019","(9촀\0A 2\0Ā촃walking leaf looks just like a
regular leaf to me. Why's everyone
so excited?"
"020","(9촀\0So that's a 2\0Ā촃bell cricket.
\0( (6촀\0They're a lot
more pleasant to be around without

"021","(촀\0You gotta break outta your shell
now and then. Eyein' a 2\0Ā촃cicada shell's
a good reminder of that!"
"022","(촀\0Now there's a shade of blue I can
get behind. Much obliged,
2\0Ā촃rosalia batesi beetle."
"023","(촀\0The 2\0Ā촃damselfly's got a svelte look to
it. It's quite somethin'!"
"024","(:촀\0If I'm not mistaken, this is the
selfsame 2\0Ā촃mosquito that snuck
a long sip of me a while back."
"101","(촀\0You're the entomologist who
