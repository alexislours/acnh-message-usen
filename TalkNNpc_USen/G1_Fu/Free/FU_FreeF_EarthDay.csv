\0(촀\0 In honor of Nature Day, maybe
I'll buy a shrub from \0Leif \0￿if I see him.\0\0(1촀\0Ahhn\0\0
\0 I just love that time of year
when all the plants are set to burst.\0\0(촀\0Everything's coated in the softest
layer of green,
\0 and the air smells
fresh and crisp.\0\0(촀\0The earth is simply miraculous!
\0
There's no other way to describe it!"
"002","(촀\0I feel for \0Leif \0￿at this time of year.
\0
(촀\0He's always hopping from island to
island,
\0 selling seeds and plants.
( 촀\0That said,
\0(촀\0 I'm grateful every time he
stops on this island.\0\0When I've got shrub fever, (촀\0
\0he's the
only one who's got the cure!"
"003","()촀\0If you plant flowers of different
colors next to each other,
\0 you could
end up with a hybrid blossom.
(촀\0I love when gardening can become a
little science experiment in your own
backyard, n\0."
"004","(촀\0Nature Day is a great excuse to pick
flowers to wear in your hair or
brighten up your home.
( 촀\0But then again,
\0 it's Nature Day,
\0
(촀\0so maybe I should just leave the
beautiful blossoms untouchedn"
"005","(촀\0It's easy to take our island for
granted,
\0 but Nature Day
\0 (촀\0reminds us
that it's our most precious resource."
