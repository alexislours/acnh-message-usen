today's an awesome chance to put
your agility training to the test.\0\0(촀\0There are eggs hidden EVERYWHERE.

Up in trees, 

"002","(촀\0I tried asking \0Zipper\0￿ how he trained
to do all that dancing in his costume
without passing out from the heat.\0\0(촀\0He told me it wasn't a costume and
to quit asking, n\0."

floating by.

down somehow, n\0?"

earlier and spotted a weirdly colorful
message bottle, n\0.\0\0(촀\0Opening bottles and jars is below my
weight class though, so I just left it
there. 

earlier and ended up catching a
Bunny Day egg instead of a fish!\0\0(촀\0The egg still put up a serious fight
though, so I'm gonna count that as
my arm workout for the day."
