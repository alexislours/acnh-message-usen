then, n\0!"
"008","(촀\0So an old buddy of mine has invited

\0that's a solo sport.

"015","(촀\0Hey! I've got a totally built question
for you—(촀\0which muscles would you
rather work on, n\0?"
"015_a","My biceps."
"015_b","My triceps."
"015_c","My quads."
"015_d","My delts."
"016","()촀\0That choice says a lot about
you, n\0.\0\0(%촀\0The bent-arm biceps pose is a classic
symbol of strength.\0\0(촀\0I bet you're a traditionalist who
is ready to put the work into
making progress."
"017","()촀\0That choice says a lot about
you, n\0.\0\0(%촀\0The bulgy biceps tend to get the
glory, but you choose the triceps—
important and supportive muscles.
(촀\0I bet you're a faithful friend who
doesn't mind showing support from
the sidelines."
"018","()촀\0That choice says a lot about
you, n\0.\0\0(%촀\0The thigh muscles are important for
extending your legs, running, 
\0and
even just standing up.
(촀\0If I had to guess, I'd say you're
really good at fundamentals
like kindness and honesty."
"019","()촀\0That choice says a lot about
you, n\0.\0\0(%촀\0Shoulder muscles help with throwing
and swinging and, most importantly,

lifting stuff.

lift up friends and inspire them
to greatness."

"022_d","Basketball."
"023","(촀\0That makes a lot of sense.
\0 In soccer,
strong teamwork and play execution
are really important, n\0.\0\0(촀\0You really gotta use your head out
there.
\0( (촀\0And not just to hit the ball!"

kick in, n\0."
"032","(;촀\0Oh yeah?
\0(촀\0 I figured you'd have a
reason for it, n\0.\0\0(5촀\0I often style my hair so it cuts down
