(촀\0Maybe sleeping with my fishing pole

but I LOVE a good tournament!
\0 (촀\0Oh,
by the way, it starts at 9:00 AM."
"004","()촀\0So here's my philosophy on
catching fish for the Fishing
Tourney in a nutshelln\0\0
(촀\0If you examine the moral teachings
of some of the 18th century's
pre-eminent thinkersn\0\0
(촀\0you'd be super bored!

the whole tourney. 
\0(촀\0But I want to
win it in STYLE, n\0!"
"007","(2촀\0Whew! What an event that was.
\0 I had
no idea I'd do so well! 
\0And I couldn't
have done it without my fans.
(&촀\0Do you know if the MVP award is a
trophy, or a medal, orn\0\0?
\0(5촀\0 I just need
to free up some space in my display."
"008","(7촀\0I don't know about you, but I'd
rather be caught than the one
doing the catching, n\0.
(;촀\0Ha HAn\0\0 Ern"
"009","(&촀\0How'd you do in the tourney
today, hmm?\0\0(5촀\0The results may not show up on
paper, but I truly feel that I won
the event in my own way."
"010","(1촀\0Don't you just love the push and pull
of a competition like this? 
\0The give
and take? 
\0The win and lose?
(촀\0Sorry, I'm just trying to make
conversation.

being struck by lightningn\0\0
(촀\0Oh, just talking about the one that
got away. 
\0((촀\0It was THIS BIG!"

want to scare off the fish, you know?
\0(
(촀\0You've got to be smooth.
(촀\0If you get too close too soon, you'll
just freak them out. 
