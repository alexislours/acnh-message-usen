the Bug-Off that I couldn't sleep
last night.

just pacing and twitching nervously

(촀\0The Bug-Off starts at 9:00 AM!\0\0(촀\0Are you ready, n\0?"
"004","(촀\0Now, the way I approach a typical
Bug-Off is to try to get inside
the head of a bug.
(&촀\0What motivates the bug? 
\0What
drives the bug to BE a bug?
\0
(3촀\0And that is how I CATCH the bug.
(촀\0Hey!
\0 Are you writing this all down
or what?"
"005","(""촀\0Heya! 
\0You bringing in the bugs
or what, n\0?"
"006","(촀\0I still haven't found a bug with
just the right FEEL, you know?\0\0(촀\0Yes, I'm aware of how this contest
works, thank you very much!"
"007","(2촀\0Wow, what an event.

thank the organizers, the fans,
really everyone involvedn\0\0
(5촀\0If anyone wants to interview me,
I've got copies of my rider available
and my own sound team."
"008","(촀\0I'm not really used to chasing
anything, you know?

the paparazzi chasing me!"
"009","(&촀\0So, how'd you do in the Bug-Off?\0\0(\0촀\0Me? (촀\0Well, I don't like to measure
my performance strictly in terms
of ""bugs caught,"" you know?
(5촀\0I have my data team working on
the analytics right now."
"010","()촀\0The Bug-Off is a delicate game of
cat and mouse, you seen\0\0\0\0(촀\0Today I was the cat, but you never
know what tomorrow will bring."
"011","(촀\0Hey, I know I've got a lot of
interesting things to say, but
we're in the middle of the Bug-Off!"
"012","(1촀\0You know that feeling, when you
catch the perfect bug?

(*촀\0chills, you know!
(촀\0I also get the same feeling from
picking out the right pair of shoes
to wear, so maybe it's just me."
"013","()촀\0Bug catching is all about positioning.
\0
You've gotta be at just the right
distance when you strike.
(5촀\0If you do it just right, the bug will
practically jump onto your net.\0\0(\0촀\0But get too close,

next flight off this island!"

bugs yet, n\0?\0\0(4촀\0I'd tell you about the ones I netted,

understand, n\0."

would be so physically exhausting?
