"001","(5촀\0Most folks don't know this, but
there's a Lunar New Year in addition
to the regular one.
(촀\0It's kind of like the cool, secret
New Year that only insiders know
about, n\0.
(촀\0What do you mean, ""like half the
world celebrates it""?! 
\0((촀\0I knew about
it first!"
"002","(&촀\0Did you know that today's the
Lunar New Year?
\0((촀\0 I had no idea!\0\0(촀\0I spent months coming up with a
perfect resolution for regular New
Year so I can blast it on social media.
(촀\0But I'm totally unprepared for this!"
"003","(&촀\0So how do YOU celebrate Lunar
New Year? 
\0Because I'm not really
sure what to do with myself!
(1촀\0Sure, I could cook up some
촀 and belt out a
few 촀 tunesn\0\0
(촀\0But that's, like, what I do

(!촀\0OK! 
\0First up—촀!

Then we do a little 촀
and snack on 촀.
(촀\0Oh! 

"005","(&촀\0Do we really need two different
New Year celebrations?
\0 (5촀\0Of course
we do, n\0!
(%촀\0And since today's the lunar variety,
we should be moonwalking all over
the place and drinking 촀.

\0(촀\0 I just really
like it!"
