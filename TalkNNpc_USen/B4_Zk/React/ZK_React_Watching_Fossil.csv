"001","(촀\0That thing's claws are really sharp,
huh? 
\0And how do you say its name?
Is itn\0\0deinonychus?
(9촀\0More like deiNOPEnychus if you
ask me."
"002","(촀\0Everything must have been bigger
back in the dinosaur times, right?
\0
Like, just look at this giant deer.
( 촀\0It's straight-up giant!"
"003","(9촀\0So, this is a pteranodonn\0\0 It looks
kinda rough now, but I bet it was
majestic in its time.
(촀\0Probably the n
\0
of the sky!"
"004","(9촀\0It's the most terrifying dinosaur of
all timen\0\0T. Rex!\0\0(촀\0Too bad about that name though.
\0
I could have come up with
something more scary."
"005","(촀\0I think this dinosaur was a peaceful,
plant-eating one, 
\0but (촀\0MAN! 
\0Look
at those plates!
( 촀\0You could cut 2\0촀
right in half with one of those
bad boys!"
"006","( 촀\0It's hard to imagine that creatures
this large were just walking around,
minding their own businessn"
"007","(촀\0Yo, those are some pointy tusks!
\0
(촀\0I'd probably poke myself constantly
if I had tusks like that."
"008","(촀\0This thing HAD to be the smile
champion of its time. 
\0Just look
at those big, beautiful chompers!"
"009","(9촀\0Wait, so this is a eusthenopter-
\0
(촀\0WHAT? 
\0(촀\0With confusing branding like
that, no wonder it went extinct."
"010","(9촀\0They say that the 2\0Ā촃dunkleosteus
got its name from how hard it
would dunk on smaller fish.
(촀\0Just kidding!
\0( (9촀\0It's from how it 
would dunk proto-donuts in its
mesozoic mocha every morning."
"011","(촀\0So this is a Quetn\0\0Quetzan\0\0Quetzaln\0\0
\0
(촀\0It's my pal Q!"
"012","(촀\0Really?
\0 REALLY? 
\0We're calling this
a fossil now?\0\0(9촀\0This explains how horrible fashions
can come back into style just
because they're super oldn"
"013","( 촀\0Is this really an ancient creature?\0\0(촀\0I'm sure I have, like, eleven of
these guys scurrying around my
basement right now."
"101","(촀\0Heyn\0\0did YOU donate that fossil?
\0(6촀\0
And I'm here lecturing you about
it like a know-it-all. 
\0So cool!"
"201","( 촀\0Uhhn\0\0that kinda looks like my uncle.
\0
But it can't be, right? 
\0This thing is,
like, thousands of years old.
(촀\0Then again, Uncle Joe is
pretty wrinklyn"
