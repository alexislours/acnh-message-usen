}\0\0!
(7촀\0Honestly, I don't know if I can

(촀\0YES! 

\0 You ready
for this?"
"005","(촀\0Yeah, I should probably wait for
ideal lighting and a seven-way
mirror.

\0Well, here goes nothingn"
"007","(%촀\0You're right. 

three hours anyway."

"100_a","Lookin' good!"
"100_b","Hmm..."
"101","($촀\0You really mean it?

\0( (촀\0I better change
before the paparazzi captures me

"102_b","Good idea."
"103","(촀\0Hmmn\0\0really? 
\0I guess if you say so,
I'll take your word for it.\0\0(촀\0Maybe it just needs a little test-wear
around the island.

\0-style!"
"104","(촀\0Ahh! 

"201","(촀\0I just love the material. 
\0Leave it
to s촁 to pick out
something so cozy."
"202","(5촀\0It kinda makes me feel as bubbly
as s촁 herself!"
"203","(2촀\0I should have known that
s촁 would pick
out something so stylishn"
"204","(촀\0You know, s촁 can be
a little abrasive at times, but
she does have a good eyen"
"205","I still can't believe that
s촁 picked this
out for me!"
"206","(촀\0To thinkn\0\0s촁 picked
this out, and it's not even
made of spandex!"
"207","(촀\0Of course, the question isn\0\0did
s촁 just find this
buried somewhere in his closet?"
"208","(촀\0It's light, it's fresh, it's on-trendn\0\0
It must be from s촁.

(6촀\0That guy really knows his stuff."
"209","(촀\0How could I stay mad at
s촁 after this?
\0
I'd better go apologize too."
"210","(촀\0You know, I really let myself get
carried away with s촁.
\0
She can ben\0\0a lot.
(9촀\0But I should swallow my pride and
go apologize to her.\0\0(1촀\0Maybe I'll swallow some
촀 first, with
a little 촀n"

s촁 after alln\0\0\0\0(%촀\0It was so nice of her to pick out such
a perfect present for me."
"212","(7촀\0Even after our knock-down, drag-out
fight, she's still thinking about me.
\0
That really says a lot.
(%촀\0I should definitely apologize to
s촁 before she
changes her mind!"
"213","(촀\0You're probably wonderingn\0\0how
did I ever get in a fight with
s촁, right?
(촀\0I think it was over 2\0
촀, honestly.
\0(
(%촀\0Anyway, I should go apologize."
"214","(촀\0I guess I pushed s촁
too far this time. 
\0I thought he
was all about pushing his limits!
(촀\0Ah, well. 
\0He did his part, so now I
should go apologize. 
\0Guess I better
do some crunches first.
\0(촀\0 Ha HA!"
"215","(촀\0Wow, s촁 must have
been feeling really bad to
actually go and get me a gift.
(9촀\0I should go apologize to him in
person and listen to one of his weird
rambling stories for good measure."
"216","(9촀\0I realize now that I've been
taking s촁
for granted.
(촀\0He even got me an apology gift.
\0(
(촀\0What a guy."
"300","(촀\0Of course, I'm just happy that
s촁 was thinking of
me. 
\0It's all about the gesture!"
"301","(촀\0The actual gift isn't as important
as the fact that s촁
sent one at all.
(%촀\0Yepn\0\0I really need to grow up and go
apologize to her. 
\0((5촀\0Puttin' on my big
n

"302","(촀\0So I guess this is how
s촁 plans on making
things right with me.
(촀\0Well, fashion heals all wounds!

It's not like us to be in a fight
like this."
"304","(촀\0Got the message loud and clear,
s촁.
\0 I guess I wasn't
really thinking of her feelings.
(%촀\0Yep, this clinches it.
\0 I've got to
go apologize."
"305","(7촀\0We all know that s촁
isn't the best with wordsn\0\0 But this
speaks pretty clearly for him.
(%촀\0I'm gonna go apologize to the
poor guy."
"306","(촀\0It really says something that
s촁 took time out of
his busy workout schedule to do this.
(%촀\0I should buff up my own feelings
and go apologize to him."
"307","(촀\0s촁 isn't exactly
known for being polite, so it really
says something that he sent this.
(촀\0I've gotta go apologize to him
before he changes his mind!"
"308","(촀\0It wasn't quite what I'd normally
expect from s촁, but
the message is clear.
