\0You did it!\0\0In\0\0I can't believe it! You got
everything right!\0\0Color? Check. Shine? Check. Size?
CHECK. You made everything about
me perfect!\0\0We have a word for people like you
in the snow world—amazing. Did you
get that? Uhn\0\0mayn\0\0ZING!!
Bud. I'm so happy right now. I know
it's dangerous for snowfolks to cry,
but I don't think I can help myself."
"001_02","You're looking at pure snowfolk
perfection right here. But you know
that. You made me!\0\0I'm the real deal, thanks to you, bud.
I'm perfect in every way that involves
rounded snow.
YOUn\0\0know how to build a
snowperson."
"001_03","
\0Your perfect \0Snowboy\0￿ is here!\0\0It's not braggy if it's true. And it's
only true because of you!\0\0Just point me in the direction of the
nearest snow museum, and I'll be on
my way, 'cause that's where I belong.
Or I can stick around here and show
the locals what a flawless snow
creation looks like."

"002_01","Ohhhhh!
\0 So close!\0\0My head should be a little better
matched to my body.\0\0But I shouldn't be so pickyn\0\0 I mean,
you did bring me to life.\0\0That was super cool of you! I'll just,
uh, work on polishing up my looks
whenever I get a chance."
"002_02","Ohhhhh! So close! I was almost a
perfect snowperson.\0\0It's the little details that mattern\0\0\0\0You know, like making my head the
right size for my body. But who am I
to complain?
\0
You did bring me to life, right? That
was a pretty cool thing to do."
"002_03","Almost! So, so close.\0\0Giving 90 percent to a project is one
way to go, sure. But that extra effort
takes you to the pro snow circuit.
And I really want to see you on the
pro snow circuit.\0\0Ohn\0\0 Sorry. I should be thanking you
for making me! Son\0\0thank you for
making me!"
"003","<"
"003_01","Umn\0\0 We, uh, didn't quite get me
right. And by ""we"" I mean ""you.""\0\0I bet you were just going for ""good
enough."" But is ""good enough"" really
good enough for a snowperson? No!
You have to put your whole heart
into it! Every flake matters! 'Cause
I'm feelin' kinda so-so right now."
"003_02","Huhn\0\0 You went with this size headn\0\0
Interesting choice. Verrry interesting.\0\0No. It's good. Really. Everything's
finen\0\0 Justn\0\0finen\0\0\0\0Gaaaaah! But I could have been
so much cooler with just a little
more effort!"
"003_03","Yo, y'all! It's suh-suh-\0Snowboy\0￿ time!\0\0Cool slogan, right? I'm sure everyone
will be saying that pretty soon here.\0\0Youn\0\0don't seem convinced.\0\0Well maybe I'd have a better slogan
if you'd put a little more work into
making me cool! This is on YOU!"
"004","<"
"004_01","
\0Wonderful!\0\0Just. Wonderful.\0\0That's some snowy sarcasm, or
""snowcasm,"" in case you were
wondering.
You know, as my head ball was
rolling end-over-end, I had a feeling
I was going to end up like this.
I would have said something, but I
didn't have a mouth yet. And nown\0\0
Now I just feel unnnncool."
"004_02","What. Is. Going. On.\0\0Bud.\0\0Crafting the perfect snowperson isn't
a skill that comes easily. I get it.\0\0But this is ridiculous!\0\0Were you not wearing gloves? Did
you sneeze while putting me
together? COME ON!"
"004_03","I was really hoping to go into snow
modeling or snow acting.\0\0But I guess I could be a prop in a
holiday scene, even if I do look a
little off.\0\0Excuse men\0\0 The snow around my
eyes is meltingn"
"010","<"
"010_01","I can't praise you enough for your
top-notch snow-sculpting skills.
Whoa. That's kind of hard to say."
"010_02","Even I can't play it cool here. I'm
practically melting with appreciation
for you and your snow skills."
"011","I think it's only appropriate that I
share a DIY recipe with such a gifted
snow crafter. Let's seen\0\0
I know! I'll show you how to make
2\0}\0\0!\0\0Check out your NookPhone!"

"013","And take a \02\0Ā촃large snowflake\0￿ too.
It's required to craft the item."
"014","Orn\0\0not. You're holding too many
things. Why don't you sort that out
and then find your way back to me?"
"015","I've placed it with your belongings.

Use it to make a special item of mine."

you. But you're holding too much
stuff, bud.
Get yourself situated, come back,
and I'll give you something good."

belongings. Now go on and craft an
item that'll remind you of me!"
"021","<"
"021_01","Bud. I am so excited at how coooool
you made me."
"021_02","Wown\0\0 I could be a snow model.
And YOUn\0\0\0\0You've got the makings of a pro

"021_03","I was built cool, and it's all because
of you, bud. Thank you so much."
"030","Oh, hey!
\0 I'll give you this now, 'cause
I couldn't before."

\02\0Ā촃large snowflake\0￿!"
"033","I was built today, so I guess that
makes today my birthday! I'm soooo
glad I was born soooo cool.
I'm in a giving mood, so I'm going to
share a way to make a special item."
"034","I was built today, so I guess that
makes today my birthday! I'm soooo
glad I was born soooo cool.
I'm feeling generous for my birthday,
so here's a little present for YOU!"
"040","<"
"040_01","Bud. I got a \02\0Ā촃large snowflake\0￿, and I
want you to have it.\0\0Put it to good use!"
"040_02","Here's a \02\0Ā촃large snowflake\0￿ for an
expert snow sculptor.\0\0You might think every snowperson
has a huge collection of these, but
they're actually hard to come by!"
"041","<"
"041_01","I'm so embarrassed. Turns out I had
this \02\0Ā촃large snowflake \0￿stuck to me.\0\0Please take it away from me. It's
caused me too much grief, and I'm
sure you'll find a use for it."
"041_02","Oh, hey!
\0 Take this \02\0Ā촃large snowflake\0￿.\0\0It's the least I can do to thank you

a \02\0Ā촃large snowflake\0￿!\0\0It's my dramatic parting gift to you,
handed over as I melt into oblivion...\0\0Which is actually way more fun than
it sounds!"
"042_02","Take this before I melt away, bud.
It's a\0 2\0Ā촃large snowflake\0￿.\0\0Keep it close, and remember me
fondly when you use it.\0\0Too much? Yeah, just craft something
cool with it."
"050","Snow ruled the land not so long ago.
I'm talking about yesterday..."
"051","Spring is so colorful.
\0 It really makes
me stand out!"
"052","It's hot, butn\0\0I've heard summer is
even hotter.\0\0I don't wanna think about it."
"053","I'm getting rarer by the minute.
Pretty soon, I might be the only
snow around. Cool, huh?"
"054","I won't be around forever, you know.
Pretty soon, I'll have to melt on down
the road.\0\0I don't mean to sound so cold. I will
miss you. It's just that I have ice
water running through my veins."
"055","Well, I hope to see you next year, but
I guess that depends on whether or
not you build me again!"
"056","It's my birthday today! Cake sounds
yummy, butn\0\0no candles, please."
"057","This seems like a very nice island.
It'll be fun hanging out here!"
"058","I know I was just born today, but for
some reason I just don't feel like a
kid. I'm an old soul, I guess."
"059","Hey! 
\0You wanna play rock-paper-
scissors?
\0 Ready? Here we gon\0\0\0\0Umn\0\0 Sorryn\0\0 I just wanted to try."
"060","Would you believe me if I told you I
was an alien? I mean, I did fall from
the sky, you know.
Actually, I fell in a million pieces. I'm
like an entire alien civilization!"
"061","Even snowfolks get cold sometimes.
I bet you didn't know that."
"062","This island is a good home, but I
wouldn't mind traveling a bit.\0\0You known\0\0meet some snowfolk from
all over the world, compare snow
stories, try some new snow foods."
"063","Snowpeeps have it easy when it
comes to working out.\0\0One good freeze, and we've got
muscles like sculpted steel."
"064","I've lost a little weight lately, but it's
mostly water weightn"
"065","I've heard all about summer, but I'd
really like to experience it first-hand.\0\0I know! Be careful what you wish for,
right? It's just that I'm kind of a
daredevil, and I really want to try it."
"066","It's funny to think that everything
about me fell from the skyn\0\0even
my voice!"
"067","You know what would be a good
home for me? A walk-in freezer
would be a good home for me."
"068","I am really impressed with the way
you made me. I'm not vain, I just
appreciate the craftsmanship."
"069","The one drawback to being perfectly
crafted, is that everyone wants to
stop and admire you.\0\0It wouldn't be such a big deal, but
I can't even sign autographs."
"070","Yeah, I'm pretty much the new
n!\0 mascot.\0\0I mean, can you blame folks for liking
me so much? I'm gorgeous!"
"071","Ah, the admiring stares of my many
fansn\0\0 I hope I'm this gorgeous the
next time I'm reborn!"
"072","It's a good thing I'm not completely
perfect. I'd probably be stuck-up."
"073","I think I have a really good chance
at winning the island's ""Best
Snowperson of Z\0"" award.\0\0There isn't a lot of competition, and
I've heard the judges value slight
imperfections over flawlessness."
"074","You know that wake-me-up feeling
you get when you take a deep breath
of fresh, icy-cool air?
Yeah, I get that all the time."
"075","I'm kind of an island superstar today.
But I'm one good trans-oceanic wind
current away from going global!"
"076","Well, I might not be perfect, but I can
have a good attitude, you know?
That's on me, bud."
"077","If I were a snow sculptor, I'd
probably roll me up a nice snow
home and a cool snow car."
"078","It shows character to accept one's
lot in life. I've got a lot of character,
bud. Yep. A LOT of character."
"079","All snowfolks melt sooner or later.
Might as well enjoy the riden\0\0and do
it all again next year!"
"080","If only my head had been made a
little bit biggern\0\0\0\0But you know what? I'm just gonna
accept who I am and be happy."
"081","I feel like I have a body-sized head
and a head-sized body, you know?\0\0The key to making good snowpeople
is to make body-sized bodies and
head-sized heads."
"082","I might not have great aesthetics,
but I've got great balance with this
big base. Son\0\0there's that."
"083","My balance isn't so great because my
head is so big. I feel like I have to
stand still so it doesn't roll off."
"084","I really don't want to be on display,
but snowfolks live outside, son"
"085","You know, I'm getting more and more
comfy with the way I look. Perfection
is overrated."
"086","I get a real low-level view of the
island. I tend to notice a lot about
everyone's feet.
Sorry. Didn't mean to make you feel
self-conscious. You have good feet."
"087","OK. Here's my last wish of the year:
Next time you make me, try to make
me look a little moren\0\0cool."
"088","My small head is going to melt faster
than my body. What will my body
think about when my head is gone?"
"089","This little body has a hard time
supporting my big head. On the
plus side, I'm very smart."
"090","I have a bit too much snow packed
around my body to see my feetn"
"091","I think my body is going to collapse
under the weight of my headn"
"100","Aaaand nice to meet you!
\0( Finally, we
can talk face-to-face!\0\0I was eager to meet you, even when I
was still just a million little flakes.
Nice work rolling me up, bud.
As you can see, I'm \0Snowboy\0￿!\0\0I won't last forever, so let's have
some fun on this island while we can."
"101","Now listen, to thank you for making

events are worth some celebration!"
"103","I can't believe this is your first time
making me. I mean, just look at men\0\0
I'm perfect!\0\0It's a real head-scratchern\0\0 Or it
would be, if I could scratch my head.\0\0I sense incredible talent emanating
from your crafting hands. We'll see
great things from you in the future!"
"104","Your snowcrafting sensibilities are
admirable. For your first snowfolk,
I look pretty good.\0\0With just a little more practice, I'm
sure you can build a perfect me!\0\0I hope you'll craft me again. I'll be
monitoring your ""snow""-gress.\0\0Maybe you'll make me with a better
sense of humor next timen"
"105","Welln\0\0 I've been made worse. And
this is your first build, so I'll let a few
mistakes slide. Try again sometime!"
"106","If I'm being honest, I'm not what you
would call an amazing snowpersonn\0\0\0\0But everyone's gotta start
somewhere, right? Keep trying,
and I'm sure you'll get me right.
Balance is the key. Keep that in mind
for next time, OK?"
"107","Now listen, to thank you for making
